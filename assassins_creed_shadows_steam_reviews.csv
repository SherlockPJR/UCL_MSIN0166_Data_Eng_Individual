191961666,english,"So I am leaving this review after finally managing to play this game. My internet has been super slow so it took me 3 nights to download, I finally launched it and I find that it runs horribly to the point of being unplayable on a HDD. If you are like me and your main storage is a HDD good luck playing this game. I've never seen a game that struggles so hard because of the drive its on... Cutscenes will basically buffer (they freeze to load) every like 2-3 seconds, and even in the prologue for Yasuke I had an issue with a certain part where it just makes you sit and wait for ever so it can load a cutscene... This is by far the worst experience I've ever had with a game on a HDD. My motherboard only supports one M.2 SSD right now, and my PSU only has enough SATA outputs for two drives, a splitter could work but the issue is that the SATA cable that plugs into the motherboard, my motherboard only has 2. So although I will not refund, I do wish to play still. I want to let those who do not have a SSD or storage space on an SSD, that your experience will be horrible. Aside from streamed cutscenes it actually runs quite well. The game has no other issues I've experienced beyond this stuttering. No game should suffer like this because of an HDD. I've played Space Marine 2 for example, and while the loading times were HORRENDOUSLY long, I could play without issue. So why do I have such an issue with this game Ubi? You're meant to be a AAA studio, how have we normalized AAA titles being worse than indie titles? AAA is meant to be high quality, the only thing high quality about these AAA titles anymore is the graphics, the games typically run poorly because who needs optimization? They're buggy messes, typically the same old games re-released because they did well in the past (Call of Duty, I'm talking about you).

Anyway, again, this game is good from what I've heard, it runs well from what I've heard too but just remember that if you don't have a SSD you will regret buying and downloading the game! I will continue to play the prologue and if it runs normally outside the prologue I will update this review but for now, the game has massive stuttering issues on a HDD, as bad if not worse than playing AC1 on pc today.. (for those that haven't, its bad, stutters almost every 5 seconds. There is a fix though)",False,0,0,1743776826,76561198821975080,106
191961543,english,"I`ve played this game for just over 24-hours, mostly with the Shinobi and a good few hours with the samurai.  I feel that I`ve played it long enough to be able to formulate some feedback, the game deserves this.
  
If you enjoyed playing Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla you`ll love Shadows as it’s the same style game but more finely tuned, simple things like being able to go prone, auto follow an NPC.  If you prefer the original style Assassins Creed games this isn’t for you, but I would recommend Mirage.
  
Whilst the world is smaller than the previous games it’s still massive.  I`ve found Shadows a lot of fun to explore, there is something relaxing about wandering the unbeaten path.  The visuals are beautiful, as is the sound, the tiny little details, the changes in weather and seasons.  It’s all very immersive.  This the most fun I`ve had with a modern-day Assassin’s Creed game, I`ve actively wanted to go off exploring and haven`t got bored doing so, it feels less hollow than some of the others.  I recommend using exploration mode, it’s more akin to an RPG when you must actively explore a bit to locate your target, rather than just being on your map, it adds an extra level of fun and achievement when you find what you’re looking for.
  
This is still Ubisoft’s tried and tested formula.  You’ll still find yourself repeating certain types of missions, such as clearing a castle, assassinating someone, but even so, this just feels better than its predecessors even if it is a well-presented grind at times.

Having the choice of playing Shinobi or samurai offers 2 distinctly different playstyles.  I prefer the ninja`s stealth approach, it`s is done really well, it reminds me of an old PlayStation 1 game called Tenchu.  The samurai is basically a tank and much more equipped for combat.  I found it enjoyable to carve through enemies I`d previously meticulously stalked and assassinated as a shinobi.  I played 75% of my time in stealth, so openly walking into a castle and taking on all comers felt quite invigorating and slaughtering them by the legion was flipping fun.  I use my ninja to go in and scout, maybe steal something, kill the odd leader samurai and then send in the samurai tank to clear up.

There were complaints about historical accuracy, as its historical fiction and in previous games you fought the pope, I wasn`t over concerned about this.  Whilst the story is fictional it does give you a lot of information regarding feudal Japan in 1579.  It’s delivered in the form of codex’s, along with supporting historically accurate information and imagery.  I`ve found myself taking the time to read these and I`ve then gone on to research further, it’s been a good learning experience that began by gaining the basic information through this game.

Whilst I had a strange glitch when I first installed the game that caused everything to run slow, which was strange as I`m using an i7 and 4090 it was resolved when I reinstalled the game on the same hard drive as Ubisoft+ and then it ran like a dream.

As for the story, it’s basic, full of cliches, very much in the style of samurai media such as 13 Assassins, Last Samurai and Shogun.  Having watched 13 Assassins after I played Shadows for a while, it really did highlight how the game is stylized and pays homage to these kind samurai films.  I found myself ending some fights and thinking its cool this. 

There are a lot of different things to do, things gradually open the more you play, which is better than it all being there immediately, there’s basic base building which I feel is delivered better than previous games.  There is a battle pass, but it seems like it’s included as part of the game, and you don’t spend money to progress.  You complete daily challenges, and it naturally unlocks tiers, and you gain whatever the item is, it feels like a free version of something from Diablo 4 and it encourages you to take interest in completing the challenges.  I`ve found myself doing these.  There is the usual paid stuff, exactly like previous games where it’s completely optional.  Its not something I`ve paid into but if there is something I like I may consider it, probably not at the steep prices they are currently offering.

My favourite Assassins Creed game was Black Flag, it’s the only one I`ve completed and I now feel that I`ll complete this one.  It`s not flawless, I`d score it an 8 – 8.5 out of 10, but its thoroughly entertaining and good at what it does.  If you compare this to some of the more recently released poorly optimised games it stands out as a winner.

191961234,english,"Here's something I didn't expect to ever say again, but here we are. ""I am enjoying the new Assassin's Creed.""

Now listen. Don't get me wrong. Old AC was SIGNIFICANTLY better, but this game isn't actually that bad. The RPG elements (despite me still hating that they're in an AC game) don't hinder the experience anywhere near as badly as they did in Origin and Odyssey, because the COMBAT is actually decent!!! Happy days! In fact, I think I think I'd even say it's fun, which is weird, since I've always preferred the old combat, but I genuinely think this game might have the best combat system.

191959532,english,"After playing for around 35 hours, I can confidently say this is one of the best Assassin's Creed games I've experienced in a long time.

The graphics and world design are absolutely stunning—if your system can handle it, you're in for a visual treat. What really pulls me in, though, is the immersion. The open world is so vast and beautifully crafted that I often find myself wandering off the main path just to explore. Out of the 35 hours I've played, I'd estimate at least 20 were spent simply roaming, discovering new locations, and soaking it all in.

Now let’s talk about the castles. I’m genuinely surprised when I hear reviewers saying they got bored looting them. Personally, I enjoy every moment of those encounters—they’re atmospheric, well-designed, and satisfying to complete.

As for the quests, my advice is: don’t just follow the quest board right from the start. Let yourself get lost in the world. As you explore, you naturally stumble across new quests and targets. My quest log has grown to five times its original size simply through exploration—and that’s part of the fun.

Finally, the seasonal mechanics are a game-changer. Snow, rain, and shifting environments not only look incredible but also add depth to the gameplay and open up new opportunities for stealth and strategy.

Bottom line: give this game a fair shot. It’s easy to judge from the outside, but if you take the time to dive in, there's a truly rewarding experience waiting for you.",True,0,0,1743775000,76561198022115523,2066
191958597,english,"I actually love this game. At first I was skeptical if I should buy this or not. turns out I don't regret buying it.
Open world - I feel like i can ride on a horse for hours. just to wander around in the world and discover new places [mainly because of 2 reasons: the graphics are amazing and really beautiful & the activities, for me, are so cool and interesting]
combat - Yasuke and Naoe use different fighting styles. Each style amazes me, I love it. but, I wish Ubisoft would have done something like sucker punch did, the stances [i just want more different combat animations].
skills tree - it sucks that there are not so many... what sucks more is that the different skills don't offer new combat animations. would have been cool.
About the story, I didn't finish it yet. what actually surprised me is the fact that this game made me crying and getting chills kinda at the beginning. I didn't cry from any ac game since Unity. 

bad things:
the assassin enemy while he sleeps bug - I couldn't assassin an enemy that was sleeping... he kept waking up to life
base on mountains, slipping down + enemy is stuck - one time I kept slippering down while fighting a big ahh enemy, I couldn't fight him cause he was stuck at the corner and I kept sliding down
enemies are stupid - super disappointing. u can assassin someone without his buddy noticing, standing 2m next to him.
naoe makes me feel sometime like she's an ai service support bot - when helping npcs around the map and gathering scouts/rumors 
English has really bad dubbing

191955160,english,"[h1] Best AC RPG Games, For Anyone Who Have Played and Liked AC Origins and Odyssey [strike] maybe Valhalla [/strike] [/h1]

[b] The Game [/b]: Beautiful environment, the dynamic weather is so good. Best game graphic I've ever seen (i don't play much tho) and it runs decent in low specs machine. Better story (than odyssey at least), a LOT dragging in the middle but very interesting in the end. The story is just begin near the end wtf. I like the new objective board, many many don't like but personally I loved it cause is so much cleaner and easy to track. There is a slight improvement in the open world such as NPC reacting player behavior and random encounters remind me of RDR2 but not as deep as RDR2 (at least they tried). Dual protagonist is done right both in story and gameplay, has two side story that maybe will connected later also enabling two different playstyles by playing Naoe or Yasuke. The bad is just old ubisoft open world formula, where is so tedious and repetitive also exploring doesn't reward as much just do it for points. Also missions is just kill this, kill that. But not a problem for me, I even liked it but under a right dose of playtime. As expected from the previous iterations

[b] Ubisoft connect [/b]: So far it is smooth even with low bandwidth internet connection. I don't have same problem with the majority issues.  My game just crash twice in the span of 100 hours playtime and I'm not sure it is from the game or ubisoft connect

[b] Miscellaneous [/b]: Play canon mode with immersive mode, very recommended 👍

[b] Conclusion [/b]: Highly recommended for [u] AC RPG [/u] fans who have played the trilogy (Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla) and want more, this game is the game. Full price or wait discount is depends on you whether you wanna play now or later. Money = time. For me, I did not regret and satisfied with the game even with full price, once again because of playing previous game I've formed expectation in mind and have expected what to comes in the game

Looking forward for the DLC and the QoL updates, dear Ubisoft ;)

191945621,english,"Okay, first of all — this game is amazing. I’ve always been a fan of the Assassin’s Creed series, but Shadows really hits different. Being set in Japan already got me hyped, and the game absolutely delivered. You can choose how you want to play — either sneaking around like a ninja or going full samurai mode and slicing everyone up. I love that freedom. It doesn’t force you into one style, so you get to mix it up depending on your mood.

Graphics & Environment:
The graphics are seriously next level. Everything looks so real — from the way the leaves fall in the wind to how the villages and castles are built. It really feels like you’re in old-school Japan. You can tell the devs put in a lot of effort to make it look historically accurate, and it totally pays off.

Story & Characters:
The story is super engaging. You play as two characters — Naoe, the stealthy ninja, and Yasuke, the powerful samurai. Both have cool backstories, and I liked how their paths connect throughout the game. It made me actually care about what was happening instead of just skipping cutscenes.

Gameplay:
Combat feels smooth, and switching between the two characters keeps things fresh. Naoe is great for sneaky missions, and Yasuke just straight-up dominates in fights. The stealth system is also pretty fun — like hiding in the shadows and using the light to your advantage. It adds a bit of strategy instead of just button-mashing.

Stuff That Could Be Better:
Okay, not everything’s perfect. Some of the finishing moves start to look the same after a while. Also, the enemy AI isn’t that smart — sometimes they just stand there when they should totally see you. I did run into a few crashes too (CTDs), which kinda sucked in the middle of missions. And yeah, if you turn on the “guaranteed assassination success” for Naoe, she becomes a little too powerful. It takes some of the challenge away.

Final Thoughts:
Even with those issues, I still had a blast. It’s easily one of my favorite AC games. The visuals are amazing, the story is cool, and the Japan setting is just perfect. If you’re a fan of the series or just into samurais and ninjas, you should totally check it out.

Ubisoft's *Assassin's Creed Shadows* is a game that completely blew me away from start to finish. After many years of following the franchise, this title stands out as one of the best in recent memory. As a long-time fan of the series, it's rare to see a game so full of heart and originality, and *Shadows* delivers both in spades.

The game introduces two characters: Yasuke, a skilled and determined warrior with a deep past, and Naoe, a sharp-minded, tactical assassin with unique abilities. Both characters are brilliantly developed, offering entirely different playstyles that make the gameplay experience both refreshing and exciting. Yasuke’s combat feels grounded in sheer power, while Naoe’s precision and stealth-based skills make you feel like you’re truly navigating the shadows. The ability to swap between the two allows for a dynamic, varied experience, with each character bringing something new to the table.

What really sets *Shadows* apart is its setting. Ubisoft has gone to great lengths to create a world that is authentic to rural Japan, showcasing the beauty of the landscape while capturing the essence of the time period. From serene temples to lush forests and busy villages, every environment feels alive and true to history. The level of detail in the architecture, clothing, and even the soundtrack adds to the immersive experience.

But it's the story that truly elevates this game. It's not just another Templars vs. Assassins narrative. Instead, *Shadows* focuses on deeply personal struggles and conflicts within each character. You can feel their internal battles and moral dilemmas as the game progresses, which makes every decision and moment feel significant. The game’s storytelling is emotionally gripping, making you invested not only in the world around you but also in the characters themselves.

I’ve seen some negative reviews floating around, and I can’t stress enough how misguided they are. This isn’t a simple rehash of old formulas. The departure from the usual *Assassin's Creed* structure (and the overdone Templar vs. Assassins conflict) is incredibly refreshing. The story is rich, the characters are memorable, and the gameplay is a joy to experience.

*Assassin's Creed Shadows* is undoubtedly one of the best entries in the franchise in the last six years. I’m hopeful that the upcoming DLCs will continue to explore the journeys of Yasuke and Naoe, and I look forward to seeing how these characters evolve. If you’re a fan of the series, or even just looking for an incredible game to dive into, don’t let the overhyped negativity discourage you—this game is a masterpiece and a true testament to the potential of the *Assassin’s Creed* universe.",True,0,0,1743748966,76561198115736799,7279

The writing in general is surprisingly, I would even say shockingly good. The characters are likeable, the cutscenes can be genuinely moving, and the cinematography is good. However, I highly advise you play either with Japanese voice-acting, or Immersive Mode -- something offered when you start the game up, where characters and NPCs speak their native language (mostly Japanese, save for a handful of Portuguese-speakers) with subtitles.

The soundtrack is great; largely, it's very traditionally Japanese, with a skillful use of other forms of music that reminds me a lot of Quentin Tarantino and Samurai Champloo -- you can see clear similarities to both of those (though especially Tarantino) in the cutscenes. 

The game truly feels like traveling through Japan, to the point that, if you've spent time in Japan, you'll feel nostalgia playing it. 

The gameplay is Assassin's Creed, so take it or leave it in that regard. The combat is fast and deadly (especially if you're playing as Naoe), but, ultimately, whether you like or dislike Shadows for its gameplay depends on if you like Assassin's Creed's gameplay in general. It's not Red Dead Redemption 2 or anything, most of the gameplay (outside of base-building (yes there's base-building)) involves either stealth or combat.

Overall, my only real complaint (that doesn't boil down to ""is an Assassin's Creed game) would be the occasional bugs. Nothing game-breaking, just occasional things like an NPC not dying after you stealth kill them (though remaining motionless and being able to be stealth-killed again).",True,0,1,1743744775,76561198311306458,1667

191928704,english,"[h1]Ghost of Assassin's Creed[/h1]

[h3]Love the game so far. Best AC game since Black Flag.[/h3]

[b]General Comparative Observation[/b]

It's hard not to compare this to Ghost of Tsushima. It's better in some ways, worse in others. If you played GoT and thought, ""Dang, I wish Jin was a full-on samurai!"" or ""Dang, I wish Jin was a full-on ninja!"" then Shadows will give you that experience. If you liked GoT, you'll probably like this game.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Yasuke is slow, ambling, loud, and not-at-all agile. When playing as him, the game feels almost nothing like an AC game. It's both refreshing and unsettling. He can barely climb, is super slow at it, cannot grapple, and is, by far, the least graceful of all AC characters in any iteration. But in combat? There has never been an AC protagonist like this. He is a brutally vicious, intimidating, powerful, and destructive samurai. He smashes through walls, bowls people over, dismembers and decapitates, can take a beating like no other AC character before him, and is just generally this hulking samurai monster. When playing him, you feel like you can march into any enemy territory and fight off hordes of soldiers like some Kurosawa film. The combat really shines while playing the samurai.

Naoe is the polar opposite. She is lithe, small, almost fragile, even. She can be killed by some enemies in 2 hits at full health. She has to hit people [i]way too many times[/i] sometimes to defeat them. She does orders of magnitude less raw damage than Yasuke. But! She is a [i]ninja[/i]. An absolute shinobi in the truest sense. She comes with all the trappings of a traditional AC character: Eagle Vision, Wrist Blade, marking enemies, hide ability, and even belly crawl. She can jump, flip, climb (fast!), grapple hook, dive, run fast, dodge roll, jump over enemies mid-combat, etc. With her build/powers, she can basically turn invisible and assassinate most anyone eventually. While not the character you should use for a direct assault, she is [i]deadly lethal[/i]. Perhaps the single most lethal assassin in the series, so far. And lemme tell ya, it's fun playing a friggin' ninja.

[b]Story[/b]

I've really enjoyed the story. Lots of hate out there for this game in every form--especially the story--but I don't see it. ([i]There's a trend in hating on AAA titles these days--see my Starfield review for that tea.[/i]) Enjoying a story is totally subjective anyway, so I won't begrudge anyone their dislike of it, but for me, it's been engaging so far. I have a hard time connecting with almost any protagonist I cannot create in a game but I've been able to engage with both Yasuke and Naoe quite well.

[b]Graphics & Performance[/b]

Holy Heck! This game is gorgeous! It is amazing to walk, run, and ride through the countrysides, towns, and cities of the late Sengoku period in Japan. I sometimes just stop and watch the world pass as the wind whips, pollen, leaves, and other debris flying by, while lightning cracks in the distance, followed by thunder, then a light rain starts. The game is surreal and finally feels like the first ""next gen"" game I've played lately. Avowed is beautiful, for example, but Shadows has achieved an even higher fidelity.

If I want native AA at 100% rendering in 4k, I have to tune the settings down from Ultra to a mix of High and Mid to achieve flawless 60 FPS. But I don't do that. This game has implemented DLSS and frame generation very well. I leave everything at Ultra with a custom DLSS setting at 50% - 100% with frame generation on, and achieve flawless 4k 60 FPS under all circumstances. The game is beautiful and I almost never see a hint of screen tear or artifacting in frame generation. Using the NVIDIA technology, this is one of the most performant games ""out of the gate"" I've ever played.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I mostly base my reviews on the price point vs. the time (hours) of enjoyment I've been entertained by a game. I bought the game at the $69.99 price point, totaling $73.03 USD after tax. I'm at 43 hours so far in this game. By that math, I've spent $1.70 USD per hour on enjoying playing a cool parkour samurai ninja game. That's cheap entertainment. I am sure I'll end up with about double that time or more. So, cost ratio of the game for the enjoyment I am getting is great value.

While I'd much rather prefer the OG formula of AC, I am also an avid looter gamer so the shift didnt bother me one bit. In regards to this game it is 100% the correct step in the right direction. I understand that the RPG aspect may drive away OG fans but if I'm ubisoft and I'm committing to the rpg formula and wanted to cater to fans of such for the next game I would start to work in some of the older feature that gave the franchise more charm. If you love the RPG formula and AC this is the game that will give you hope easily can turn into hopium Ik but if Ubisoft were smart the next game should integrate the parkour system Unity had while also providing more verticality tothe maps like kinda instead of having these flat villages theyve been copy and pasting the last 5 titles . Allowing much more stealth mechanics that previous games had live blending in with crowds or even allowing to you to hire bystanders to create crowds, things like throwing a coin purse to create crowds. essitailly the next step would be to increase crowd density and more vertical map designs with an enhanced stealth and parkour mechanics on par with previous titles and you have  a staple in the franchise potentially top 5

191920804,english,"After logging 30 hours, I think it's time I uninstalled it and hid it. I really want to love Assassin's Creed Shadows due to it being a childhood fever dream I had back when the latest and greatest AC game was Black Flag. If this game had been made back then, we'd be having a totally different discussion right now. But Ubisoft's reoccuring attempt to bring RPG mechanics into an AC game, along with their extremely flawed current Open World game design, Shadows falls flat harder than any of the other AC RPG's i've played. Origins, Odyssey and Mirage set the standard for a lot of people in terms of what they want in a decent or good AC RPG game. Being a die hard AC fan, I expected them to make a japan assassin RPG work; But none of it sticks.


For the first 10-15 hours you enjoy doing story missions, outposts, finding new villages and shrines to collect knowledge points; then it suddenly dawns on you that for the past 15 hours you spent playing, that's all you did. No unique side quests with unique storylines. no other unique interactions with the open world other than getting to a Viewpoint to mark more undiscovered locations. On top of that, doing Outposts always gives you legendary gear after completion, voiding any value to any of the gear you find in the Open World. So, you are strongly encouraged to complete outposts to obtain legendary gear, so that level scaling is less of an issue than it was in previous years. Because of this half-baked concept, It becomes a cycle of leveling up, doing outposts, leveling up, doing more outposts. When all these things start to become realized, you find yourself kind of tired with the game during an outpost or story mission, and you put the game down to never pick it up again.

I also maxed out my entire Hideout in less than a day because someone on the quest design team thought it was a good idea to create a contract that pops up once a day where you can loot an ABSURD amount of hideout materials from a tiny little chest in a tiny little fenced up enemy base in the woods that will set you up for life in your first 5 hours of playing, but you can only get 100 stone total from robbing AN ENTIRE ARMY BASE worth of materials. I am frustrated; I am extremely frustrated with myself in the fact that I trusted Ubisoft once again to not fuck up, to actually do right, but once again I have played the fool, maybe I will be a fool for life.

Still kind of annoying, but there is at least a workaround. I still stay above 60 fps pretty much all the time (though with some minor frame pacing issues), so I'll update the review if I continue to have a crash-free experience. 

I want to preface this by saying I am actually genuinely enjoying this game. The world is beautiful, the story is engaging enough (using Japanese voice acting so I don't have to listen to the godawful English voice acting), and the stealth and combat feel great after getting the hang of them. However, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. After around 15-20 hours (right after finishing Act 1 and unlocking Yasuke permanently), the game is crashing literally every 10-15 minutes. For such a demanding game, it's actually relatively well optimized. But having to reboot after 10-15 minutes constantly while just exploring the world is unacceptable. Hopefully a patch comes out in the next few days to rectify the issue, and then I would actually recommend it (for around $35-40).

191899226,english,"One of the most mixed bags of gaming I've ever played, but definitely a step in the right direction compared to the past few assassins creed titles.

The combat is pretty meh. Yasuke feels too easy, and Naoe feels more in line with the assassin mechanics and was more fun to play. A lot of skill tree abilities are locked behind side quests, that become very copy and paste with hunting down organizations over and over until they lose all impact. But playing as Naoe and infiltrating castles for better gear are where the game truly shines. Murdering an entire stronghold without being seen feels amazing, but even this starts to wear off near the middle of the game. 

The writing is uninspired. There are a few good moments sprinkled throughout, but the large majority of the story and characters aren't worth remembering. Yasuke feels too safe, written as one without faults and as a consequence lacks any real depth. There was a lot of potential to make his and Naoe's relationship contentious, slowly but gradually becoming friends as they realize the potential in the others fighting style, but instead they just immediately become best friends out of the blue which makes their relationship unbelievable and wreak of lazy writing. 

Its a solid 6/10 game.

191893833,english,"Assassin’s Creed is one of my favorite franchises. It has stumbled quite a bit over the years and many things steadily got improved on only to be erased completely in later entries, to then be resurrected in newer titles, like stealth and parkour. Altogether though, this game is great. There is still room for further improvement, but this is easily the best entry the modern AC formula has given us. 

The combat is much smoother and more refined than the previous games. The stealth is the absolute best in the series (if you play on Expert stealth difficulty) the addition of a prone and a light/dark mechanics feel great, sneaking into a temple and silently extinguishing all the candles to lure enemies into a pitch black kill house. The parkour is… probably the area that needs the most innovation. It works, but it’s not expressive or fun, or particularly fluid. All they really need to do is copy and polish the system that Unity had, and give us denser cities with taller buildings again. 

The story is yet again, another revenge plot where a family member is killed by a Templar and you end up going down the path of the Assassins. The modern day plot was really interesting up through AC3 and at least held some weight in most later titles. Here, it equates to the echo of a fart in the wind. To top it off, the dialogue in this game isn't great. The writing and the delivery both. Thankfully they did add the option to have characters speak their respective languages, like in Ghost of Tsushima, and the Japanese voice acting sounds much better than the English acting. What’s even better, is the lip sync animations change depending on which language the characters are speaking. This is a pretty small detail but it’s much appreciated because it’s something I noticed not changing when using the Japanese audio in GoT. 

The open world is gorgeous especially with the inclusion of seasons. The weather system is also pretty impressive, with really heavy wind gusts blowing enemies of balance and branches off of trees, blinding snowstorms covering your infiltration, and torrential downpours that mask sprinting footsteps. Another thing I want to praise is this game’s phenomenal transmog system. You need to build a custom forge at your hideout by scavenging resources out in the world, but once the forge is up and running you can apply visuals of other gear to what you have equipped. You can even mix and match aspects of each weapon. You can take the serrated blade from a bleed katana, a fancy ornamental hilt from a legendary sword, a handle wrapping that matches your environment or has a cool little tassel, and put it in an inconspicuous sheath normally relegated to the low-level or practice weapons. I don’t know if any other game has this, but it is absolutely amazing here. Now it just needs to work with the outfits somehow…

A lot of comparisons to Ghost of Tsushima are being made with this game, and they mostly favor Ghost in pretty much all aspects. Well I’m here to tell you differently. Whereas Shadows is a terrific open world RPG, I think Ghost is a great action game that doesn’t justify its open world beyond having a pretty landscape. I got the platinum for that game and for me, the combat really outstayed its welcome by the end of it. It always felt good to parry or dodge at the last second, but I hated having to switch my stance for every other enemy, with large fights having to switch between stances like 10-15 times just to fight 5 or 6 people effectively and it ending up feeling a little cumbersome. Here, when combat is set to forgiving, the combat feels a bit more akin to Sekiro with the core of combat centering around well timed dodges and parries that put your enemies off balance and into a vulnerable state. Some enemies have armor that acts like a fortified posture bar that you must break before they are knocked off balance. You can kill most enemies in 3-4 hits or less with parries and dodges, but you still die in the same number of hits if you’re clumsy. The stealth in Ghost was also very basic and was essentially just Far Cry 3 in Japan. You crouch in bushes and kill enemies when they get close. There is not a mechanic to hide in darkness, there is not a prone option to hide in tall grass or roll under buildings, there is not environmental destruction that enemies use to cut bamboo and bushes down and weed you out during searches. The open world simulation is also just more impressive in general. The draw distance, lighting quality, and AI scripting all do a lot more than Ghost did, as you can see entire mountain ranges dotted with temples and castles in between the glowing cities and towns. As much as I like Ghost, the open world feels oppressively bleak and barren. The landscapes are pretty but the only thing happening anywhere is the invasion. Even in the sanctuaries and towns, almost nobody is walking around, there aren’t groups of people looking at shops or people ordering food at stalls or kids playing tag in the alleyways. Shadows has all kinds of slices of life you can observe, people making kimonos, brewing sake, playing instruments, dancing, eating, drinking, hanging out with their pets, washing and drying their clothes, sweeping floors, trimming bushes, collecting flowers, dusting furniture, and so many more little animations and interactions that you don’t really see much of or at all in Ghost. Because again, that game had very little going on outside of the invasion, which is fine. They are both aiming for different things and I think they both are exceptionally good at what they try to do.

The controversy around Yasuke is so insanely fucking stupid and I really wish I didn’t feel like I had to comment on it, but seeing the discourse online makes me want to tear my fucking hair out. I see posts about “Yasuke wasn’t actually a samurai or a ninja, and this historical record states he was just a bodyguard” (as if being a bodyguard to the daimyo could be considered insignificant anyway???) or “Ubisoft is racist for playing hip-hop music during Yasuke’s segments” or some other equally asinine take. Well first of all, Assassin’s Creed has never been historically accurate, Ezio fistfights a super-powered pope at the end of AC2 and people consider that the best in the franchise. Or what about Da Vinci making Ezio’s wrist mounted gun, or a literal battle tank? AC was never meant to be accurate to history, just authentic enough to be immersed in the adventure they’re trying to take you on. I would understand the hip-hop complaint if it was at all accurate, but of course this is taken way out of context. Hip-hop music can play during combat, whether you’re playing as Yasuke or Naoe, but it’s not always playing, there is quite a mix of all genres of music here and I honestly think people are just hyper focused on the hip-hop because Yasuke is black. The idea that having any kind of African American influence is disrespectful is insane to me. Yes, Yasuke is not African American, just African, but he didn’t make this game. Ubisoft did, and they have always been filled with a wide variety of historical, cultural and religious influences. It’s almost like that exact message has been shown on screen every time you start one of these games, ever since the first one.",True,0,0,1743703658,76561198056493506,3817

Alot of the progression in game were force locked behind quests that after you've done them, in retrospect, feel like time sinks and barriers to try prolong your game time, and the so-called side quest activities like Horse Archery (a stupid waste of time, not fun at all), Kuji-kiri (makes you play through a limited area in Iga as Naoe that no matter how advanced in abilities and equipment your current Naoe is, you are forced to being a total noob to face numerous enemies and boss fights where all you could do was attack, parry, dodge - another stupid waste of time), Temples and Shrines (basically just getting you to run around stupidly looking for praying points and hidden pages hidden in weird places all over the area, totally pointless, and ends up being the fastest way but also the grindiest way to get the Knowledge Points you need), Kofuns (labyrinth like, puzzle solving cave systems that if you're claustrophobic, you are so going to hate; even if you're not, I hardly find the appeal of this 'tomb-raidng' experience, I am not playing Lara Croft or Indiana Jones for god's sakes) were all unnecessary, unrewarding, and you had to do upwards of almost 100 of them to max out the so-called benefits which are actually kinda crucial to the gameplay (for Knowledge points and therefore Knowledge Rank, to get at higher tiers of the skill tree to spend your Mastery Points).

Most of the romance-able characters and characters you could recruit now have a bigger variety and diversity, including plus size women (Yaya), plenty of gay/lesbian romance options of various characteristics, but they felt very surface level (not historic characters like those in Odyssey), and were included for the sake of DEI and LGBTQ+ and activist reasons.

Character controls are serious clumsy most of the time, and not just for Yasuke; the entire experience of moving and combat is clunky, and easily the worst of the entire series to date in my opinion. Navigating the open world is frustrating as hell if you try to go direct to objective most of the time - there are so many, so many, so many trees and trees that keep blocking your field of vision everywhere you go once you veer off the main path, plus so many unscaleable cliffs and hillsides you keep sliding down that just frustrate your experience of travelling. And speaking of travelling, going everywhere is manual, there is no auto movement to objective following a tracked path. Had this in Mirage, don't know why they excluded it in Shadows.

Cosmetics wise, while it's nice to have the customization and engraving options, but there are really just a few color coordinated, good looking helmets and armor in game (and after you collect the Templar armor set for Yasuke and the Assassins outfit for Naoe everything else just looks bad) - the cosmetics in the Shop obviously look way alot better (and they are not cheap), but the stark difference in design (and the Store sets come with unique engravings that you cannot get anywhere else) betrays Ubisoft want to milk the players; back before, store cosmetics were presented more as a purely cosmetic choice you could have, which are different to the selection in game, but not 'so much better', which, being a completionist and collector myself, I was way more inclined to buy because I appreciate the game I appreciate the effort they put in, and I wanted to complete my collection; in Shadows, I certainly was not compelled at all to get any of the store cosmetics with stats.

Knowing that they are also working on AC: Jade and AC: Hexe at the same time, I am honestly left wondering if the rumors are true that Ubisoft is on a steady downward path, and the AC series going forward is going to be even more downhill from the disappointment that Shadows is.",False,0,0,1743686239,76561198068160574,6910

191860793,english,"TLDR:
Not a masterpiece, but definitely not trash either. Ubisoft did their thing, and it works. Good mix of RPG and old-school Assassin’s Creed. Some annoying stuff (no time skip, no auto-travel to waypoints), but overall a solid experience. A must get for Assassin's Creed fans.

REVIEW, without spoilers obviously:
After completing the main story, epilogue and collecting all achievements at 63.4 hours, I think I'll leave my review as well.

Let’s get one thing straight, the loudest hate seems to be coming from people who either never touched an Assassin’s Creed game before or just have a weird agenda caused by childhood traumas, or are just looking validation from other Nurgle followers.

Now, is Assassin’s Creed Shadows a masterpiece? No.
Is it terrible? Also no.

Ubisoft sticks to their formula, and love it or hate it, they’ve refined it to the point where it just works. Sometimes it hits harder than other times, and I think this one lands on the better side. They grabbed good elements from other RPGs and older AC titles, threw them into Shadows, and it mostly paid off.

But yeah, not a masterpiece.

No time-skipping mechanic is a weird omission, especially in a game where stealth is a big deal and shadows actually matter. You also can’t change seasons, which means running through snow feels painfully slow. And man, no auto-run/auto-travel to waypoints? That’s pain for lazy people like me :D 

Microtransactions? Look, they’ve been a thing for years. If you’re still shocked by it, I don’t know what to tell you. It sucks, sure, but they’re mostly cosmetic. Don’t buy them if you don’t want to. Simple.

Voice acting? Mixed bag. I started with English, but switched to Japanese pretty early and didn’t go back. Japanese VA felt way more immersive for me.

Graphics-wise, it’s really solid. There were plenty of moments I just wandered off to explore the world. Ubisoft really nailed the vibe there.

Did not encounter any crashes, or Ubisoft launchers issues, any major bugs or anything out of the ordinary throughout my whole playthrough. 

All in all, Shadows isn’t reinventing the wheel, but it’s a strong entry in the franchise if you know what you’re getting into.",True,0,1,1743668893,76561198129096642,3805

191855028,english,"I completed the game main storyline, all assassination and all ally mission in about 80-90 hours,  completed odyssey but could not finish origin and valhalla, Shadows is surprisingly good, and i strongly recommended anyone to play this, especially if you love japan culture, and this is the best AC game since Origin, AC games never meant to be rush through and do not believe some streamer who rush through the game and tell you it is bad.

[h3]Graphic[/h3]

- Beautifully crafted world, town fill with NPCs doing their work, animals wandering, leaves scatter across the game in autumn, you can climn onto any eagle view and it become the best 360 paint, it is just as you walked into feudal japan in real life
- Four seasons and weather, i think this is the first game who implement this, the whole game change its season and weather as time passed, rotating through spring, autumn, summer and winter, tree grow and fall with season, terrain slow you down in winter, while many games only implement map specific season, while the changing weather is very common now, but Shadow deliver a manificient work, storm and rain feel great.
- The light, which i think the main reason the game look so beautiful, with Raytracing on, light feel natural and pretty, moonlight feel soft while the sun feel strong but not blinding, i strongly suggest playing this with Raytracing ON
- Texture and character look good, but this is common and expected from AAA game right now
- The graphic is so good that i can write another thousand word

[h3]Audio[/h3]
- Sound effect are great, weather audio is beautiful
- English dub is normal, i tried immersive mode, which basically the same with japanese voiceline, cause 99% is japanese anyway, but i spend more time looking at the scene instead of subtitle
- There are some questionable music during Naoe flashback in the end, but overall is fine

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
- The same loop you can expect from the previous AC game since origin, most are conquering castle, lighting up eagle view, exploring interest point, go to point A and kill this, etc
- Some side quest are interesting
- Enemies type are few, but what can you expect from japan other than shinobi, samurai and archer?
- I enjoyed it so far because of the beautiful landscape, i do not feel like the repetitive gameplay as a chore as i did not rush the game and enjoy the journey

[h3]Customization / Combat[/h3]
- Combat / Stealth feel distinctly difference between two character, people can use any of them in almost all the whole game
- Naoe focus on stealth, able to climb higher, move quieter and faster, weak in HP but elusive, use classic shinobi weapon like kunai, kusarigama ( chain with steel ball and blade ) and short sword / dagger
- Yasuke focus on combat, much higher HP, can crush wall and fight multiple enemies with ease, use heavy weapon like Long Katana ( Odachi ), Gun, Long bow, Huge hammer, and polearm
- Stealth improved, enemy see you from far away and on rooftop if you expose in light
- Gear and Talent customization are good and complex enough for casuals
- Combat execution is mixup of light attack, heavy attack, dodge and blocking
- Animation look nice especially Yasuke deliver strong and impact combat with his uniquely large body size and strength

[h3]Performance[/h3]
- 3080TI and 10900, 2k, max settings with FSR support, DLSS set to balanced, raytracing medium
- Good FPS, with such godly world and intense population of moving vegetations, animals, NPCs, items react to storm and rain, i can still get 70-90 fps across my whole game play
- No glitch / bugs at all, except one time that i see some floating fishes on the land
- The performance is at least 100 time better than the other game with no open world and is only about killing monster and harvest their tail with sword larger than themself

[h3]Lore[/h3]
[spoiler]
- It is all mainly about Naoe and Yasuke executing their revenge, Yasuke for his lord Oda Nobunaga and Naoe for her clan
- Animus / Assassin creed story barely existent but kept me exciting about the future DLC for the true creed story in japan
- While executing their revenge, uplifting japan from the bad and tyrant
- Yasuke lore is fine, and there are zero romance unless you choose to, they are all totally optional, yasuke as a foreigner naturally know the world outside of Japan, and being a black slave know the importance of freedom
[/spoiler]

[h3]Controversy[/h3]
- Micro Transaction / Battle pass - NO, there are no ADs that prompt to your face, no extra purchase require, no bottleneck / artificial difficult to hold you back, you do not need those unique legendary power from the store, they are just for stupid people who would fund your future game and make it cheaper
- Romance - NO, they are totally optional, and no romance in canon mode
- Story heavily sided to Yasuke - NO, Yasuke and Naoe have their share against the whole AC vs Templar scenario
- Yasuke - [spoiler] Yasuke as a foreigner make more sense the the story vs Templar from THE WEST, while they could have better story with local japanese but at least the current lore is fine, they do not glorify him as the ultimate or most prestige samurai, people only know him from his skin and size, nobunaga's giant, his unique size make his combat as one man army more believable [/spoiler]

- Black Samurai - What is wrong with a bit of fiction now? Tom Cruise literally played as a Foreign white Samurai in ""The Last Samurai"" movie, AC games were never about realism,it is a game that you look into your ancestor memory with completely different ethnic / race / culture, fight against some demigod and wield immortal relic, and now people complain that there are no black samurai and female sumo in history
- DEI elements - zero LGBTQ+++++++ pronounce and zero forced romance. zero romance in canon

Go pick up the game, while Ubisoft did stupidly, overly committed into Yasuke's historical identity in Japan outside of the game, do not let those medias and hates ruin everything that are actually in the GAME",True,0,2,1743659775,76561198016883690,6487
191854817,english,"After putting 40hrs into the game I can say that it isn't the best assassins creed game out there but it isn't that bad for a down vote. I still had fun playing but at times I did find myself HAVING to finish it. 

Here are a few pros and cons.

PROS: 
-Good combat
-Good variety of weapons 
-Beautiful scenery
-Cool mechanic on the whole base building giving benefits
-Cool kill animations
-Parkour movement felt fluid and nice (some parts)

CONS:
-Boss fights are very lack luster, seemed like normal enemies. Nothing special about them.
-Story line was wack and VERY repetitive on what it had the player do
-Facial animations are dog shit, Skyrim had better animations in 2011
-Player are worthless to loot, except the higher tier enemies
-Chests are also worthless to loot except the legendary chests
-The worst thing in this game is the climbing and getting to certain places. IT IS SO BAD. Sliding down hills that should be climbable and running into trees that get you stuck forcing a reset.
-The main story line is mid. Some side missions are better than the main story line.

TLDR: It isn't the best game but has its pros. Probably buy it when it is on sale.

The game so far for me has been technically sound, and graphically breathtaking, not to mention the combat which is varied as long as you switch weapons and utilize tools. Some pointers for when you start.

1st. Upgrade the settlement and gear early and often. Dont worry about resources they are a plenty.
2nd. Switch to immersive mode. The English voice acting is circa mid 2000s anime dub and is horrid. 
3rd. Switch to guided exploration. Dont waste scouts on looking for your targets. (Use it once for achievement, thats it.)
4th. Dont waste your Mon buying gear. You can find some legendary pretty quick in early game and it can be upgraded perpetually.

191808043,english,"It is with some mixed feelings that I leave this review. I will try to touch on various aspects of the game and then give my personal experience at the end. 

The Great
The Graphics - 10/10: Very immersive. The world changes with the seasons, and the environment could not be more majestic. Parkour / Movement Mechanics - 10/10: I played on an xbox controller, and I do not exaggerate when I                                     say that I have never played a game where the movement of the main character (Naoe) felt SO good. 
Stealth - 10/10: Typical AC, but with more flair. 
The Combat - 8/10: They could have used more enemy variety, and several more bosses (maybe rip a page out of From Software's book). Despite its limitations, however, the combat feels good. 

The Meh
The Story - 5/10: A disjointed conglomerate of meaningful moments segmented by loads of mediocrity. This one element could have honestly saved the game... too bad. 
RPG Progression - 5/10: The gear upgrades never meant anything because they give you legendary items right off the bat. The leveling system was also tied to an open world filled with grindy, tedious activities. I never really felt any meaningful reward with this system. 
Questing System - 6/10: Not enough meaningful story material combined with lots of meaningless quest objectives. 
The Characters - 6/10: Though good in concept, the main characters often felt thin. The tone of the dialogue often felt contrived and hollow, reminiscent of some of the more modern Disney movies. I really wanted a more dark fantasy tone. Something that felt weighty and realistic. This, unfortunately, was a real immersion breaker for me. 
Game design - 5/10: There is a lot to say on this point. For one, I really wish they would have left DEI out of it. Overall tone aside, Yasuke is honestly--and i genuinely mean this--an amazing character.... he's just... out of place. This game is set in feudal Japan. It should have been this meaningful tribute to Japanese history / culture. I can't help but feel they cheapened that by incorporating DEI elements into the game design. This, combined with contrived dialogue, unimaginative story development, and meaningless / unrewarding questing activities, left me with with a feeling of wanting, knowing what COULD HAVE BEEN. 

My Experience - 8/10: Despite the stale nature of the traditional RPG / story elements, I genuinely enjoyed the majority of what the game had to offer. The graphics, parkour, and movement mechanics were, in the end, enough to upkeep my enjoyment of the game, despite what others might consider major pitfalls in game design. For this reason alone, I still recommend the game to other AC fans--with one caveat: that you genuinely enjoyed the other AC games. Reason being that  although there were aspects of this game I really enjoyed, I sometimes found myself reluctant to actually log on and play. There was just not enough compelling material here to motivate me without a little prodding on my part. Thus, I think if you enjoyed the last few AC games, you will likely still find this one worth playing. If, however, you did not enjoy the last few, or are really skeptical, I would definitely save your money for when the game is on sale--or just bypass the experience entirely.",True,0,0,1743608089,76561198234068296,2576
191807952,english,"As a fan of the modern open world AC games this one does not disappoint in the world or gameplay. However the story I'm struggling to get gripped to as well as the overwhelming objective board. - Some mini spoilers included.

Starting off with the world and gameplay. Something I've enjoyed with these open world Assassins Creed games is the awesome worlds that have been built and AC Shadows Japan definitely does not disappoint. The upgrades to the weather, graphics brings everything alive. I'm having a blast travelling through the world on the back of horses. The villages and towns all feel very unique and really give off the feudal japan theme. Nothing feels copy and pasted which is amazing. Similar to the other games each town having a castle to raid which can either be done in stealth or just brute force. This game has a great way of showing the Shinobi and Samurai styles which allows you to choose how you want to play (once you unlock Yasuke, more on that later). The gameplay is challenging and combat feels great. Good selection of weapons so far to use with each character. The one thing I do wish for is more finisher animations, as each weapon really only has two and it does feel stale seeing it a lot.

Moving onto the rougher side, by no means is the story terrible. I'm finding it interesting, doing the flashbacks with Naoe really adds so much more to her and her origins - should be a thing to be done throughout the story to help keep it going rather than needing to specifically hunt them out and do them. It does take some time to unlock Yasuke, I thought there would be more of 50/50 before they meet but unfortunately not. The story as a whole right now (which i haven't finished because I'm doing exploring and things at the same time. Photo mode is great too) feels very split up, almost like you need to rush through killing the main people, but equally you're bombarded with all the side quests and other targets to assassinate. I think the quest board and story navigation could have been cleaner.

191798864,english,"I’ve got mixed feelings about AC Shadows. As a product, it’s insanely polished—graphics are 10/10, some of the best in the industry, and the narrative design is top-tier. Japan’s aesthetic is breathtaking, and it’s worth it just to soak in the world. But the story? It’s not that gripping. With so many assassination targets, I kept forgetting who we’re even fighting or what happened earlier—it just didn’t stick with me.

Gameplay is a highlight, mostly. Naoe’s stealth focus is a massive improvement, super satisfying to pull off. Yasuke, though? He’s the best character in the story, hands down, but his gameplay is a letdown—basically just fighting, no depth, so I avoided him. Combat’s decent but doesn’t hit the highs of Odyssey. The scout mechanics, though—chef’s kiss. You get a vague description, find it on the map yourself, and it feels rewarding. Play in that mode if you try it.
On the flip side, it’s got this bloated MMO vibe—tons of “go here, kill this” side quests you can skip because they’re forgettable. Camp mechanics were fun for a bit, but I maxed out my hub in 20 hours and barely went back except to upgrade gear.

Verdict: Recommend it if you’re into modern AC games or obsessed with Japan’s vibe—it’s gorgeous and has its moments. Otherwise, it’s a mixed bag.

이게 어크지!

성(요새) 잠입 암살 플레이할 때는 오디세이를 즐기던 때가 자꾸 생각난다. 어쩌면 시리즈 중 BEST OF BEST가 아닐까...? 신디케이트와 오디세이의 장점만 긁어모아 만든 것만 같다. 마치 고스트 오브 쓰시마와 냉병기 위주의 메탈 기어 솔리드를 적절히 혼합한 것도 같고.

풍경 그래픽도 언리얼 엔진 5를 채용한 게임에 비해 꿀리지 않는다. 오디세이와 발할라에서의 민둥산을 생각하면... 산천에 초목이 무성하게 우거져 있다. 또한 사계절의 흐름이 눈을 즐겁게 한다. 스크린샷으로는 잘 전달이 안 되어서 아쉬울 따름.

단점이라면... 시간이 너무 잘 간다는 점. 가끔 분위기를 깨는 브금이 나온다. 시스템이 필요 이상으로 복잡하다는 인상 또한 든다. 은신처쪽... 출시 전에 언플만 좀 덜 했더라면 좋았겠다 싶은 아쉬움도 든다.

내가 일본어를 아주 유창하게는 못해도 조금은 알아듣는 편이고, 몰입을 위해서 일본어 더빙으로 플레이하는 중인데... 한국어 자막은 영어 스크립트를 기반으로 번역한 것 같다. 가끔씩 내용이 다를 때 신경이 쓰인다. 

그 외 다른 단점은 아직 없다.

만일 지금 바쁘지 않다면, 굳이 묵혀둘 이유가 없으며 즐기지 않을 이유 또한 없다. 심심하면 정가에 구입해서 즐기시라. 아참, 전작들과 바로 이어서 즐길 경우 조금 지칠 수는 있겠다. 신화 3부작은 게임의 볼륨이 굉장히 방대한 편이었고, 이번 작품의 분량도 마찬가지이니.

After finishing the game completely and seen pretty much everything the game has to offer, is miles ahead of the tedium that was Valhalla, this game actually left me wanting to know more about the characters and their stories, and hoping the game would not end. 

The game has its shortcoming, one of them is the camera, while fighting in tight places like the castles, it becomes bothersome because the camera looses focus on the character so you can't see what you are doing. Also, it has the same shenanigans that have been there probably since the first Assasin's Creed, while doing parkour, your character sometimes does not follow the directions of the controllers, so lets of the edge or jumps in the opposite direction you wanted him to go, or just jump to a place where you did not want the character to go.

Besides these two things, everything else is pretty fluid, I would have prefer one character have both functions of Yasuke and Naoe, instead of separated, but I think it works fine for the most part.

191771504,english,"Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows finally brings the series to feudal Japan, a setting fans have been demanding for years. On the surface, it seems like a dream come true: a vast open world, stunning visuals, and all the trappings of a modern AAA game. But once you get past the spectacle, it quickly crumbles under the weight of its own mediocrity. The gameplay is a repetitive, uninspired grind, the AI is laughably bad, and the story is as deep as a Saturday morning cartoon.

graphix ar gud duh

But beneath that beauty, the world is lifeless. Ubisoft continues its tradition of bloated open worlds filled with repetitive content. Instead of meaningful quests or emergent gameplay, Shadows gives you endless busywork. The world exists as a backdrop for the map markers rather than an engaging space to explore.

Gameplay: A Mind-Numbing Chore

If you’ve played any modern Assassin’s Creed game, you already know what to expect: a monotonous loop of chasing UI icons, grinding arbitrary progression systems, and completing the same handful of repetitive activities. Shadows somehow makes it worse.

To progress in talent tiers, players are forced to follow golden and white dots on the map, leading to an experience that feels more like an endurance test than an actual game. The first few hours offer a glimpse of fun, but once you realize all the best abilities are front-loaded, the talent system loses all excitement. The upper-tier skills are nothing but boring passive buffs, making progression feel completely pointless.

AI: A Total Downgrade

The AI in Shadows is shockingly bad, and not just by modern standards—it’s a step backward from Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Enemies barely react to the player’s actions, often showing no intelligence or awareness beyond a startled flinch when you run past them.

When you clear out an enemy fort, the remaining guards don’t react with any meaningful sense of danger. If they find a body, they’ll search for a bit before casually resuming their usual routine. One of the most ridiculous moments I witnessed was a samurai resuming his training—stepping over the corpse of his fallen comrade as if nothing happened.

For comparison, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey had soldiers mourning their fallen allies, sometimes even picking up and stashing the bodies. The downgrade in AI here is staggering, making the world feel even more artificial.

A Story That Thinks It’s Deep (It’s Not)

Ubisoft tries to paint Shadows’ protagonists as righteous assassins fighting for justice, but the game never meaningfully explores morality. It’s just another generic good-versus-evil tale with no depth. The story is predictable, lacks any emotional weight, and ultimately feels like it was written to check off boxes rather than to tell a compelling narrative.

Gone are the nuanced conflicts of earlier Assassin’s Creed games. Instead, Shadows simplifies everything into “my team good, other team bad,” the same kind of black-and-white worldview that plagues modern storytelling. It lacks any real historical weight or thought-provoking themes. (spoiler ahead) Even the templars and assasins which brought this fight to Japan are some fucking looser hobos in their orgs and they happily admit that.

Verdict: Straight to the Trash

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a perfect example of what’s wrong with modern AAA gaming. It’s a visually stunning but completely hollow experience, bogged down by repetitive gameplay, dumb AI, and a forgettable story. Even basic franchise staples like social stealth are missing, making this feel like a stripped-down, dumbed-down version of what Assassin’s Creed used to be.",False,0,2,1743560479,76561198017935362,4922

The combat got pretty dull after awhile but the story managed to keep me engaged just enough to keep coming back. All in All its a solid game, just another entry into the franchise. It certainly isn't what the media made it out to be in any way shape or form as is always the case.

191761059,english,"I am nearly done with this game so i can post my honest thoughts on the whole game and not some snap decision opinion and if you want the short version of do i recommend this game, well no is my answer at least not full price. It like the last game is literal junk food of a game as per usual and for a supposed 'new' beginning for the series it looks remarkably similar to the old one.

Now why i do not recommend this game is a long list so onto positives first for starters, the stealth is massively improved, but only if you put it on expert the ability for guards to detect you on elevated surfaces on expert makes you rethink much of your approach, at least at the beginning. Next some of the combat sections and story beats towards the end of the game are pretty badass compared to the beginning 60ish hours. Some of the music despite being unorthodox is actually pretty good and I would listen to again. Finally the game looks very good and when the stars align, your caught in a house or temple while the rain falls along the roof and drips down onto the ground while the sound of the rain surrounds you it feels like a great world to exist in.

Onto negatives, I want to start with Yasuke I for one do not believe he should have been a secondary playable protagonist for 2 reasons for 
1. Assassins creed should never make a real historical person a protagonist as it severely limits the game and storytelling and i will leave that point at that. 
2. Limiting his gameplay so you can 'split the fantasies' is a horrible idea. 
The next negative i have is combat and this one really annoys me as i see some people praising it and i cant help but think 'praise what?' a bunch of spongy enemies and repetitive and boring combat animations. I have seen the same dull 3 or 4 combat animations about 10000 times and its just boring and even switching up weapons doesn't really help as there are only 3 per character and if you play Naoe some of her specific assassinations are tied to certain weapons and as you can only hold 2 weapons it means 1 type of assassinate is always locked to you so for example if you don't have the tanto in a slot you cannot double assassinate. Aside for that the rest of the combat is just using the same 3 or 4 moves and once you figure out how to cheese the combat with Naoe it just dulls down the combat further i am massively dissapointed at this point in the game. The ONLY fun i actually had in combat is with Yasukes kanabo but thats because its just massively OP.
My next negative is aimed squarely at the story beware for some minor spoilers [spoiler] so to begin with let me start with the fact that this time there is no modern day setting outside of some animus talking to you bits where the only gameplay is walking around a boring blank space while exposition is spat at you about the STORY YOU ARE ALREADY PLAYING, so nothing about whats happening outside or even who you are. Secondly, there are virtually NO TEMPLARS in this game at all now you might say oh but the shinbakufu are the templars/ templar equivalent, well no because at the end it is revealed that the actual templars are in the country and then its short 1 or 2 hours in the epilogue mopping them up as Yasuke and it feels like a total afterthought questline which is a shame because this part is some of Yasukes strongest story beats and had me genuinely more interested in his made up story (i mean made up for the sake of the game as he is tied to the templars here). It just feels like a waste to me as a lot of the story pre-epilogue is just ambling around with no real purpose [/spoiler]. The story telling is slow and boring and I mostly checked out during most cutscenes because there was rarely anything gripping me into the scenes just a lot of standing around talking about not very interesting people and or things. In addition to this i think Ubisoft shot themselves in the foot by not adding any of the mythical or fantastical element from japan for instance the 'yokai' you can fight in the game are just delusional people but making them the actual folklore figures at least would add some style which the game is sorely lacking.
The map is too large and while there are a lot of things to do the quality of those things is sorely lacking you will spend multiple hours going through similar locations and performing the same 3 or 4 actions for hours upon hours to prove this point i will list the secondary activities you will do 
1. collect pages usually in a temple by running around the place in observe mode until you see a white dot (usually on a roof)
2. 'collect prayer shrines' see above except they are all on the ground and you have a 20 second animation for each one that you have to sit through
3. Kata (Yasuke only) these are weapons masters that give you combos to practice that you will never use/ need again
4. Kuji-Kiri (Naoe only) These are small 'rhythm' games you will have to complete a few rounds of button presses for it to complete
these are the main 4 but there are also tombs, paintings and parkour courses however there are much fewer of these. But these are all used to give knowledge point so you can rank up you skill trees but as you have to do so many of these to unlock skill trees they take up an annoying amount of gameplay for such little reward.

I may add more to this in time but for now i will give my final opinion and score. Personally I cannot recommend this game to anyone looking for anything interesting or fun to play, but if you are looking for time to kill and a stealth system that is more reminiscent of splinter cell then maybe look into it in a few months when the game is on sale. 

As for my score I'd give the game a 7/10 personally, although that's mainly because i'm biased towards this stealth system",False,0,0,1743547719,76561198057863819,5941

I had zero hype for this game. I fully expect it to be the usual open-world template—climb some towers, clear a million icons, do the same objectives in slightly different outfits. Nothing innovative, nothing bold. Just more Ubisoft stuff.

But I bought Assassin’s Creed Shadows anyway. Full price. $70. Why? Because Ubisoft actually grew a damn spine and stood up to Elon Musk and his crybaby fanbase. They called out the BS instead of groveling like most companies do. That alone was worth my money.

I played most of the mainline AC titles including the one where we had fist fight with the pope, remember that one?

I just replayed Odyssey, i see the improvements, after the step drop off that Valhalla was.
Dialogue is not Shakespearean but suiteable, i use the canon mode, so no idea if there are any pseudo-choices in dialogue.

Combat is fun-ish, stealth on hard is a bit random sometimes, mostly i am just too greedy.

Minor spoiler: i was positively surprised that [spoiler]one of the first marks just got shot.
Without any drama or ""last second remorse""[/spoiler], did not think they had it in them. Kudos.

I think it would have been better to just focus on Naoe, she fits pretty fine as the main character.
That said i do not really have an opionion on Jacob and Evie (they felt pretty much the same, story and gameplay wise) or Kassandra and Alexios (same), which made the choice more cosmetical.

Changing the gameplay between the 2 MC in Shadows feels weird and i try to avoid Yasuke because i do not like the style of game play he offers. Bold move, i guess it did not pay off, but there could be worse things. But i guess nothing forces me to play him much, so, well, it could've been worse.

From a technical point of view the game is gorgeous, even in comparison to Ghost of Tsushima, just a bit different art style, also runs very well, had to set raytracing to low tho for 60fps 4K with my trusted RTX4080, the Ryzen 9 7950X just chilling at 8-16%, well done.

191753645,english,"Assassin's Creed Shadows transports players to 16th-century Japan, introducing two protagonists: Naoe, an agile shinobi, and Yasuke, a formidable samurai inspired by the historical figure. This dual-character approach offers varied gameplay experiences, with Naoe emphasizing stealth and Yasuke focusing on direct combat.​ My preferred character is Naoe, as I feel like she compliments how I feel Assassin's Creed should be; a stealth game with take-downs vs full on fighting (Yasuke).

The game's depiction of feudal Japan is visually stunning, showcasing meticulously detailed environments and a dynamic weather system that enhances immersion. When the seasons change from Spring, Summer, Autumn, to Winter, this triggers world refreshes on bad guys. Players can engage in culturally rich activities such as tea ceremonies and wildlife painting. Naoe can partake in Kuji-Kiri Meditation, where you have to rhythmically hit four buttons to transport Naoe back into her past. This piece is tedious at best and feels like it should be a one-round go through, instead of about five or six rounds of hitting the same four buttons in sync.

The voice acting in native tongues (Japanese with mixed Portuguese) really nails the feeling, however it falls massively flat with English. English feels like it lacks translation, leaving the VA actress for Naoe often times dead pan or struggling to deliver any type of emotion in her lines. The VA for Yasuke is the complete opposite, often times making you feel his emotions in his lines.

Combat mechanics are refined, rewarding players who master parrying and keenly observe enemy behaviors, especially on the harder mode. There is an option to turn on one hit assassinations, which ignore the level difference that the game forces you into. There are several zones with artificial level scaling, which seems (still) out of place in my opinion for a game like this. I have been playing with the one-hit assassinations on with a harder tune difficulty to get a true feeling of being a master assassin, who if somehow is caught flat-footed, probably would die in a heavy swing.

The parkour system in the game works and looks better than most of the entries into the series. Naoe definitely makes you feel like a true assassin with how nimble and fluid her movements are. Yasuke on the other hand, can't seem to even climb over a fence without falling.

The expansive open world, though beautiful, can sometimes feel overwhelming and detract from the main story line. ​I often find myself wondering around the world, instead of doing the main story line. While obviously not a bad thing, it does seem to add to a padding of how long it may take someone to complete the game. Couple this with repetitive side quests that seem like they are an after thought in some instances, you can find yourself neck deep in the game without ever actually accomplishing anything.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Shadows successfully revitalizes core elements of the series, particularly in stealth and assassination gameplay. While it doesn't entirely overhaul the franchise formula, it delivers a compelling and immersive experience that both longtime fans and newcomers can appreciate, history barring for some. 7/10 is what I would give this game, personally. Nothing great, but nothing bad. A one time clear is plenty.

TLDR; I played 1-4 and came back for Shadows. The extended RPG elements don't really do it for me. The massive environments are beautifully crafted, but serve no purpose beyond that. At least in 4, you could sail around listening to shanties. Sound designs are great, especially with a surround system or a good gaming headset. The voice acting is a hit or miss, often times leaving room for improvement. Questing falls victim to grind-y RPG-ness, with no real loot rewards beyond finding ""gold"" level gear. I found armor and weapons early on and still have yet to replace them. Microtransactions are present (cosmetics) in this single-player game, which always feels scummy to me, even if they are just cosmetics.

191744584,english,"Now that I've passed the point where I can get a refund, these are my initial thoughts on the game, just things that I've been thinking about as I've been playing through the lengthy and quite honestly not very strong prologue and intro.

As a note, this is a very hesitant recommend. I think the game is strong considering recent AC entries, but the TLDR below summarizes my thoughts well. This isn't really going to be a structured analysis of the game, it's pretty much just going to be a bullet-pointed list because that's just how these thoughts have come to me.

[h3]The absolute simplest TLDR I can give you is that it's really hard to find something that Ghost of Tsushima didn't do better.[/h3]
I've been trying really hard to not make that comparison in my head, but given it's, like, the one other game that's most alike this one, it's difficult not to do so.

The combat feels [i]okay[/i] but I really wish it were more responsive. Too often I feel like I'm hitting the button and it's not blocking or dodging, and the way enemies attack, they don't really respond to your input in a way that makes it feel good. For instance, I dodged an attack from a 'boss enemy' and he immediately pivoted and hit me again, sending me back to a loading screen AND a checkpoint that was a little too far to make sense. The hit wasn't in a way that made sense and made me feel like I had input the dodge late or early, it was in a way that felt like the game cheated me a bit. The timing on dodges is weird too, like you have to dodge at a specific time to make the enemies ""vulnerable."" I'm still not sure where that timing is at in the animation, because it's not always at the ""flash"" their weapons make.

I like that enemies don't come at you one at a time, that was always an annoying part of the AC games, and made combat feel too one-sided.

I don't, however, like that the games have shifted to be some sort of RPG. I don't like the enemy leveling mechanics, I don't like the looter-style gear acquisition, it all feels too ""video-gamey"" for what AC has always tried to be, and that's full well knowing I just called a video game a video game. Of course, all of that is mostly to either sell you microtransactions or control your progression in a shitty and kind of not very good way. Ghost of Tsushima did all of this in a much better way, denoting enemies that were stronger than me, putting me at a disadvantage because I was lacking the proper counter-stance. Obviously that system isn't perfect either, but it felt better than ""your number is lower than his so fuck you.""

Enemies take too many hits to kill. Even when you match levels. This does not feel good at all. It's not challening, hitting the same enemy more is not fun. It's bad game design.

There are two tutorials. The same information. Twice. Bad.

I don't have any problems with Naoe and Yasuke (of whom I've seen exactly five minutes of because  90% of the prologue is Naoe), but I feel like their characters lack depth. There's reasons to give a shit about Naoe's past and her motivation for doing what she's doing, and I'm sure Yasuke will be a compelling character too once I get to see more of him, but really and truly I think AC has done this exact character plot before at least twice and it happens too quickly to really give a damn and care about the character. I'm being intentionally vague for spoiler reasons, and again I've only played about 2.5 hours of the game and an hour and 45 of that was prologue. Ghost of Tsushima, again, handles its character depth better. I won't elaborate, but if you've played the game you should know what I mean.

The last AC game I really remember enjoying the climbing system in was, uh, the French Revolution one I'm pretty sure. I have since played only Odyssey. This game has not yet impressed me with its climbing system. It feels, I don't know, like it doesn't quite do what I'm expecting it to do? I get where I need to be, but the traversal doesn't feel clean, it doesn't feel smooth. Maybe that's intentional.

Animations aren't up to par for what I expect from a game developed with this budget. Cursory google searches say an estimated $325 million for development plus an additional $400 million or so on marketing. The facial animations don't look great, some animations are quick and janky, occasionally combat animations don't happen correctly, clothes clip through characters' body parts, other clothing, just not what I expect from a studio like this.

On the subject, though, I DO like that this game has strayed away from the AAA urge to make ""immersive"" long animations to do stupid things like pick something up or loot bodies.  It still has a lot of ""hold x button to do y thing"" but that's not nearly as bad as ""hold x to pick up one thing and get locked in a 5-6 second animation every time you want to do it, several hundred to a thousand times throughout the game.""

Denuvo. Bad.

Ubisoft's shitty awful terrible garbage bad DRM that they insist on maintaining because they want to claw at any meager amount of money they can get away from Steam's (admittedly not great) 30% cut (which reduces if you make more money, apparently). Bad.

If you've come this far, I understand that I've said a lot of negative things to give this game a recommend. The truth is, I think they've done a good job taking the series in a different direction. There's a lot I don't like about this game, but I think it's worth it if you care deeply for the series or want a game to waste time on. I DON'T think it's worth the $70 I paid for it quite yet, but maybe it'll make it to that point by the time I finish the story, which hopefully will be another 30-40 hours if the pace the prologue set is anything to go by but I'm not holding my breath.

191742227,english,"So far I'm really enjoying the game. If you're like me, you loved Odyssey but disliked Origins and Valhalla. Really for me those titles fell flat in terms of main character buy-in and overall story. It just wasn't there for me.

Shadows feels a lot like Odyssey, but differs a lot from previous titles in terms of exploration. B-lining to your objective just doesn't work, there is too much terrain and foliage. Things are a lot more dense, so sticking to the roads is best advised IMO. Which is fine, because there is a lot to do and see. You also can't climb every vertical surface, basically if it makes sense, you can climb it, flat rock faces are a no-go, fortress walls with no grab-holds, etc. There are some consistency issues there, like being able to climb lap siding where there are no handle holds just fine. But overall, I think it's an okay change with the world design and hasn't tripped me up too much.

So far the story has me bought in, I didn't realize however that I wouldn't be able to play as Yasuke right off the bat, I'm 8 hours in and I think I'm just about to get to him in the next mission or two from what I've seen.

This game does fall into the same trap that Odyssey did where your gear has a huge affect on how much damage you can do. Assassinating a character with one piece of gear might be a one shot kill, while other gear will only due critical damage. Luckily with how the AI is, it won't always ruin your stealth with the rest of the base/encampment, etc that you are attacking. I also really appreciate the versatility in how you are to create ways to move around, using lighting, crawling, or view points to move around an interaction is really satisfying and makes each situation feel pretty dynamic.

It's a 8/10 for me. A great addition to the AC RPG series.

191740581,english,"I just 100% the game with 100 hours. My rating for Assassin’s Creed Shadows is 8/10！

Generally a good game, I have tons of fun. But it has some unignorable writing problems.
I know people don’t want to read the test wall, so I keep it short.

Graphically amazing! Beautiful and smooth. Maybe the best looking Assassin’s Creed game ever.
Gameplay is solid, combat is fun and kinda hard for an AC game. Stealth is harder too, but you will soon get used to it. 

Map is vast! But I think it's a little too big for my taste. Despite the large size of the map, the cities in the game are actually not impressive, they are small and boring. But the castles are the highlight, it’s very detailed and magnificent.

You have 2 characters to play, One is Yasuke the Samurai, another one is Naoe, the Ninja, that’s the definition of power fantasy. I play the Ninja the most, I prefer the gameplay of traditional AC characters. Samurai is brute, pure power, but lack agility and stealthy.  

The biggest problem is the story, this game has a big pacing problem. The relationship between 2 main protagonists are very rushed, like they were enemies a mission ago, but after the mission they become best friends forever. It doesn’t make sense.

The whole story has 3 Acts, the Act3 has the most intense story, but it’s unbelievably rushed. ACT 1&2 could take 10-20 hours respectively, but ACT 3 can be done within 2 hours. When I saw the credit roll, I couldn’t believe it just ended like that.

If you care about achievements, this game has a very simple achievement list. It doesn’t require you to get all collectables or something like that. ACS might just be the easiest to unlock all achievements.

People will inevitably compare this game to Ghost of Tsushima, I would say,  Ghost of Tsushima overall is a better game. It has better combat, better story, more cinematic. 

In the end, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a good game, worth your money and time. But haters gonna hate this game no matter what. Woke and anti-woke people are all crazy when they go extreme.

191736996,english,"Leaving this review after just finishing the main story for Shadows, without rushing through and doing a large amount of side activities (just about 80 hours invested).

Ubisoft (surprisingly) got a lot right with this game. I loved games like Valhalla and Odyssey. I wasn't a huge fan of Origins. The world in Shadows is beautiful. I found myself just walking through towns or in fields while traversing to a quest location because everything just looks so good. I had only maybe 2 or 3 visual/lighting/textural bugs that I've experienced in previous AC games years after their release, so that's pretty good for being a week old imo. 

Spoiler warning for the story and general game information.

Story started off slow and one dimensional, and I was really worried that was just how it would be the entire game, but thankfully around the 10 hour mark the plot thickened up. By the end I was really invested in some of the stories the main group of characters were experiencing. When posting this, the completion of some story elements have not been released yet, so I'm very much looking forward to finding out what else is going to happen.

But that brings me to my first complaint. Why the **** is the story not finished in the base game? The MAIN story beat for Naoe revolves around avenging her family and trying to find out information about her mother. We get info that her mother is indeed still alive, Hanzo has a lead, and then the credits roll and that's it. At this point idk what would piss me off more; Ubi releasing more of the base story information in a DLC, or if they just let it die there. Probably the latter. In either case, this is a huge pain point for me and I still don't understand why they did it.

Another critic- Naoe's voice actor sounds like AI. It was highly likely this is the fault of the studio and not Masumi (the voice actress) but this ate at me for the entire game. Yasuke's voice lines sounded great. He sounded real. Naoe sounded like most of the vendors, who sound like they were recorded by whichever janitor walked into the vocal booth when they were getting ready to lay down some voice lines. She's one of two, if not the main character in the game. No one listened to her and thought ""know what, she sounds kind of lifeless""? It's possible I'm in the minority here I suppose.

I'll try to compliment sandwich this review by saying I really did enjoy the game. I am looking forward to DLCs (admittedly this review will change drastically depending on how they wrap up the base story, if they do it in DLCs). Switching between Naoe and Yasuke ACTUALLY felt meaningful, and not just a cosmetic change of ""who do you want to play as"". Yasuke completely dunks on anything you put in front of him, but his movement is clunky (as it should be for a guy his size). Naoe is very agile and the stealth mechanics in this game feel good. I regret not using Yasuke for a while as I thought it would just be a visual change more than anything- I was very wrong here. 

Ultimately, I recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed an AC game in the past. It is an RPG. It's not like Origins was, and is closer to a gear-simplified Valhalla or Odyssey. Most of the side content is quick to complete and not overly repetitive. Also the new take on ""who's in the Animus"" is interesting and I hope they expand on it- because we never ""wake up"" as the person in the Animus to find out who's controlling Yasuke and Naoe, or why they can switch back and forth between these two people.",True,0,0,1743525688,76561198131918983,4708

Ill say this, most casual or true ac franchise gamers aren't in an echo chamber bubble, and can think for theirselves.
Others latch on to fake outrage because it fits their bias or have been telling themselves the game will be a disaster when it comes out. well it wasn't. those people must be miserable.

Now that's out of the way here are my 2 cents,

1. World - (Amazing, everything comes to life, and no time control meaning the seasons alter and you have no say or ways to control time) 

2. Stealth - (Better then it ever was, tune your difficulty to deity and everything will come to life)

3. Fighting - ( I see alot of people saying its repetitive, it definitely is not especially as you level up, the game makes you grind as the hoe at first but once you become the black guy it all makes sense, the fighting really starts to open up with a style of your preference weather you prefer being agile or just pure brute force and just walking in the front door, the fighting is more unique to ac in my opinion and gives a breath of fresh air) 

4. Story - ( absolutely cringe, its like shogun mariko sama simulator, but honestly not as woke as people make it up to be)

5. Online ( the store is shit and buying single player items is trash so fuck that, but i will say that you can actually grind for credits to buy on the online store in the game which was a little different then what i was expecting) 

6. Bugs - ( there was a few but way less then other triple A games at lunch and definitely less bugs then the last AC)

I can say with confidence and hours ive played, this game curated my itches, and its made me realize what i enjoyed most about AC which was the fighting and the open world, something i never felt after black flag, so its been a minute that ive actually enjoyed an Ac game, and for that im glad i got to think for myself, fuck off asmon, and enjoyed the game.

I also had pennies to spare, if your not a big AC or Japan Feudal themes fan, just wait for the discount.

the mechanic of the game is fun, there is lots of tools that made completing an objective can be completed in a different way. the story is meh, but the side story is actually fun. the visual is outstanding even though I played on steam deck it still have a good environment.

but there is lots of annoying things in the game. the side mission is so repetitive, on harima alone there are so many enemy base that needed to be cleared. character switching is also annoying, there is lots of time where I clearing a base then a chest can't be opened because I use naoe. so I need to go out of the base, change character, reclear the enemy, and reopen the chest. there is some bugs aswell. one time I can't synchronize a map because an eagle stuck on the tipping point, so I need to reload a save.

UBISOFT KEEPS EXPERIMENTING BUT HAS REACHED NO FINAL DESTINATION YET
I played almost 50 hours, and I managed to assemble my thoughts about this game. Ubisoft had an RPG trilogy (Origins, Odyssey & Valhalla), then it had ""back to the roots"" Mirage, and now we have somehow a platform for a good AC game ... but that's it, we have a ""platform"" but not ""contents"". Let's break it down:
==============
PROS:
- WORLD: The open world is transformed and moving in a good direction. Terrain is now a real deal, you can't just go forward, and eventually you'll reach the target like it was pre-Mirage, you'll use Pathfinder more often. Weather is a REAL BEAUTY, the team who worked on weather mechanics did a great job, the game looks fantastic. 
- COMBAT: due to having two protagonists, combat differs for each, I'll focus on NAOE (Assassin) here because the game is MEANT TO BE PLAYED AS NAOE. The combat is difficult for me. I play at the max difficulty, and sometimes I die 5 times at the same spot because Naoe just won't survive more than two hits, and if you want to be relevant in the fight, you'll have to use everything in your pocket to win.
==============
CONS:
*SPOILERS ALERT*
- THE MAIN ONE, ""PLOT"" - the game just doesn't have a meaningful plot. I still haven't reached the end, and I am probably somewhere at 2/3 of the main branch. 50 hours passed, I turn around and think, ""What was going on all this time?"" Grinding the Shinbakufu one by one without any significant development, just small separate arcs without assembling into something looking like a ""plot"". The assassins' idea didn't move forward for an inch! We had a small intro into the AC world with giving us the shadow blade, but FULL STOP here, this theme won't go any further for the 45 hours (and almost all Shinbakufu are dead). So far, the plot is just ABSENT: enjoy grinding bosses, castles, side quests (that have some end-to-end plot at least) and having the same dialogue with every boss ""- where's the box? - IDK *dies* *okay i'll ask another one then*"". Also missing modern time part of the plot, no tampliers (so far), no just any ""mythical order united under some sinister plot"" (Shinbakufu is just a bunch of masked mafia), no Assassins even (the ""ikki"" is just self-made ninja vigilante org and no trace of connections to Assassins despite playing in the end of 16th century, ~70 years after Ezio passing).
- LACKS FINE-GRAINING: The game introduced several new parkour ideas like a hook to climb and swing, but it just feels awkward, you can only use the hook while standing straight under a spot, which is difficult to see, sometimes it attaches to the wrong floor, and you can do nothing about it. I remembered Batman: Arkham series when I tried to use the hook and how it was much better done there, even though the first Arkham game is 16 years old. Combat buggs are annoying, half of the times if I die in the middle of the fight - it's because eather the input from keyboard is just missing and Naoe doesn't parry a simple swing (which rippes off half of my healthbar) OR Naoe makes turn and uses ability to nowhere between two enemies. To summarize this point, I'd like to say that AC did a good ""platform"" for future games, and they should fine-tune it instead of replacing it with some new ideas, which will be broken sometimes.
- IMBALANCE & YASUKE: Some may say that ""this is the whole idea of having two characters"" but I'll say that boss fights just cannot be THAT different playing two different characters. At some point, I just stopped going into boss fights as Naoe because she can't deal with it at all BUT if you switch to Yasuke - every boss fight is simple as rocks, you're practically immortal and left-mouse-button every boss. Talking about Yasuke, this is just Skyrim added inside AC, that's all. Rush forward, slash enemies, shoot arrows, no climbing, Yasuke even runs exactly like in Skyrim. From the ""new ideas"" perspective, adding Yasuke is interesting, but from a gameplay perspective - well, this is not AC at all.
==============
CONCLUSION:
If you just like AC games like I do,  you'll probably enjoy new eye-appealing parkour, weather, vertical mobility, and fights. But if you expect the game to give you some rich story to tell - it may be a disappointment for you. I appreciate that AC made up a good ""framework"" from the perspective of how the gameplay feels overall, but it has no long and good ""story"" to tell. The game won't be remembered as part of the AC franchise development.",True,0,0,1743506892,76561198204360471,3678

The first few hours are really well done but as soon as you get to the point you can play both characters, it goes downhill. (More accurately after you finish Yasukes memories.)
The idea of having 2 protagonists was nice, the execution horrible. You dont even need Yasuke, except for maybe 5% of gameplay and even those are mostly boring minigames. 
The story itself ends up not being that engaging after the prologue area and this might be the first AC im not going to finish.
Buy it if you want to enjoy the first 20 hours but beware that i would've refunded it if i knew what was coming after.

191715245,english,"A Stunning World, But a Shallow Experience – Wait for a Sale

I’ve played every Assassin’s Creed game across all platforms, along with most Ubisoft titles, so I know exactly what to expect from their open-world formula. Unfortunately, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is another example of breathtaking visuals masking a lackluster experience.

If you love exploring massive, handcrafted worlds, there’s plenty to admire here. The environments are stunning, easily among the best in gaming today. The combat is also the best it’s ever been—weighty, visceral, and satisfying. But once you get past the initial excitement, cracks begin to show.

The Good:
✔️ Graphics are phenomenal – Ubisoft continues to push the boundaries of graphical fidelity. The world feels alive, rich with detail, and filled with atmospheric effects that immerse you in feudal Japan.
✔️ Combat is brutal and impactful – Every slash, parry, and assassination feels rewarding. Stealth is also improved, and the one-hit hidden blade assassinations are back, which is a huge plus.
✔️ Japanese voice acting is solid – If you play, use Immersive Mode. The English voice acting is easily the worst in the franchise—painful, unnatural, and immersion-breaking.
✔️ Stealth gameplay is enjoyable – Naoe’s shinobi playstyle makes sneaking around satisfying, reminiscent of older AC titles.
✔️ The scout system is an interesting idea – A new way to track objectives, but…

The Bad:
❌ …it’s ultimately tedious – The scout system sounds cool on paper but just adds unnecessary steps to locating objectives. It’s a slower, more cumbersome version of what we had before.
❌ Story starts strong, then completely falls apart – If you’re here for the narrative, you will be disappointed. The plot never capitalizes on its promising setup and fizzles out into mediocrity.
❌ Character writing is uninspired – Every character feels one-dimensional. Naoe is tolerable, but Yasuke’s story and gameplay feel forced, unnatural, and ultimately boring. After taking over one castle with him, I lost all interest.
❌ Yasuke is absurdly overpowered – For some reason, he can literally break down doors and walls like a human wrecking ball. His combat feels more like a superhero game than an Assassin’s Creed title. Not to mention, he goes from having zero prior experience to being a God-tier samurai in a month. It makes no sense.
❌ Facial animations are shockingly bad – Easily among the worst in the series. There’s a noticeable disconnect between the gorgeous world and the lifeless faces of its characters.
❌ Music and ambience are serviceable but forgettable – Compared to Odyssey and Origins, the soundtrack is underwhelming.
❌ Framerate is locked to 31 FPS in cutscenes – In 2025, this is completely unacceptable. Mods can fix it, but why should they have to? Ubisoft needs to address this officially.
❌ Eagle Vision is clunky – It requires holding a button instead of a simple press. Why? Nobody knows.
❌ Map fog isn’t removed by sync points – A baffling decision that makes exploration feel tedious rather than rewarding. Sync points have been a core part of AC games for years, and taking away their functionality hurts the experience.
❌ There’s little reward for exploration – Beautiful as the world is, exploring it feels pointless. Most discoveries aren’t worth the effort, and there's little incentive to venture off the beaten path.
❌ They removed animal fights and pets – A small but noticeable downgrade from previous titles. Why remove features that added life to the world?
❌ Most mechanics outside of combat are boring – There’s little incentive to engage with them beyond padding out playtime.
❌ NPCs rarely talk, making the world feel lifeless – For such a beautiful setting, it’s bizarre how quiet everything is. There’s a distinct lack of ambient conversations, which makes settlements and towns feel oddly empty.
❌ Microtransactions in a single player game? Get out of here, Ubisoft. 

Final Thoughts:
It’s just another by-the-numbers Assassin’s Creed game. Definitely not what I was expecting from a struggling Ubisoft, cornered and looking to rebound. Instead of pushing the franchise forward, they’ve delivered yet another safe, uninspired entry that fails to capitalize on its setting.

As someone who has played every Assassin’s Creed game, I can confidently say that Shadows isn’t worth full price. If you enjoy Ubisoft’s open worlds and just want to explore feudal Japan, then wait for a sale, maybe $25 max. Otherwise, skip it—this is not the Assassin’s Creed renaissance fans were hoping for.",False,0,1,1743505514,76561198104048268,3741

Loot system from Odyssey returns with a mix of Valhalla's location based loot, but more refined and its extremely forgiving to upgrade your gear to your lvl if you happen to like a certain piece. The story as well is pretty interesting so far (12ish hrs in) and has been a better ""main quest experience"" than compared to recent AC titles. Feels like real effort was put in.

191702963,english,"As an avid fan of the series ever since its introduction with Altair way back in 2007 all the way to the present with Naoe and Yasuke I can safely say I've enjoyed the 100 hour epic even going in with slight skepticism. There are a few games that do leave lasting impressions on me and I am not ashamed to say AC Shadows falls into that category, especially in todays day and age where its not easy to drown out two sides of angry people berating and shaming you for not sharing the same opinion as them.

To talk about the game itself I must begin by saying that the world that was created for AC Shadows has been an absolute joy to get lost in, walking through the muddy and cobbled streets, scaling sprawling mountains and pushing past the dense forests of 1579 Japan had me enthralled with how well the game looks and even runs on my 4 year old system. There was definitely great care taken into recreating as much authenticity in the landscape and architecture here as is seen in previous titles. It is clear there has been a graphical and technical leap since Unity here that should not be ignored. Its safe to say the world crafted here is a character in itself, wind moves almost everything in sight, snow melts throughout the day and seasons change the landscape both visually and mechanically. 

Central Japan in AC Shadows consists of 9 regions all of which are vast and filled with things to do and see, especially with Guided mode off which is improved since Valhalla. The experience of discovering new objectives and stumbling onto treasures and targets feel a lot more organic than previous iterations of the ""Ubisoft formula"" There are still synchronization points littered across the map that fill it with question marks however Ubisoft have dialed back their checklist handouts with a more engaging player experience overall. The scouts you recruit on your journey, which refresh every season or with a small fee at hideouts, are used to, well, scout areas that your objective is located in. People in cities will talk about things that are happening in the vicinity leading you to encounters and targets, or miscreants along the roads would be harassing a family of peasants and choosing to intervene will reward you with information on things in that region. There are also random odd encounters that lighten the somewhat more serious tone of the game that are short but sweet. Target boards fill the objectives menu as you find these targets and information throughout the world and act as side quests which you can pursue at your own leisure. Its interesting to note that since some of these targets and pieces of information are already placed or moving about in the world while you're exploring, you can find some interesting ways to complete certain boards. 

Exploration feels rewarding to say the least, hidden caves and mountaintops have legendary loot to be found all of which do some interesting things in combat and stealth in terms of gear and equipment. The seasons in the game change the vistas you see in the game and with the draw distance being as far as it is, the world does feel like it evolves with every shift of season. 

Spring has the least mechanical changes but Summer is when foliage actually grows taller so you have more hiding spots, guards will also tend to be more drowsy during this time as the climate is warmer. Fall is when the climate gets a little colder so you will start to see more guards appearing closer to heat sources such as torches or campfires. Winter is when the game changes its terrain mechanically the most from the other seasons as shallow bodies of water Naoe can hide in are now frozen, shrubbery has shed all their leaves so there are fewer hiding spots and rooftops are prone to dropping icicles when run on causing guards to be alerted. During winter, guards will also huddle closer together to stay warm.  Rain masks the noises you make and cause less guards to be out in the rain as they actually seek cover. The day and night cycle also play into the mechanics of guard behavior and visibility during stealth such as guards being able to see light sources being destroyed from further away or there being more shadows in which you are in complete darkness.

Stealth in Assassins Creed has never been the best or even good part of the titles but in AC Shadows an attempt was definitely made to try and rectify that somewhat and I believe to some extent, it does bring the feeling back of old Splinter Cell games where you could split jump up a wall just as a guard is turning the corner and then dropping down on top of them to take them out or lurking in dynamic shadows in the world and seeing your visibility meter drop to zero while a guard walks right by you. Previous AC games always had the most stealthiest approach be from above as guards and targets seemed to have not been given the use of their necks. Expert stealth difficulty feels like it changes the gameplay quite a bit forcing you to try different avenues of approach as guards actually spot you quite easily if you're visible above them. I feel like this should have been the default but I could see at times I was getting frustrated, whether that's a good thing is if you solely want or expected the experience to be entirely about stealth. I think that stealth gameplay has been massively improved but if you're looking for the incredibly creative ways to take out targets ala Hitman games, sadly that isn't present here as they have not been in previous entries. Hopefully Ubisoft improve on stealth gameplay further and experiment a bit more now that it has a very good base to work on. Although unexpectedly there are some targets you could surprisingly choose to spare. 

Combat also feels incredibly polished upon coming from previous iterations. Yasuke feels like you're playing a raid boss when you first unlock him and then as the game progresses he feels a lot more humble, although with a proper build he still feels like he could just mow down countless enemies effortlessly. Animations feel like they play off each other a lot better and don't have that floaty feel that was present in previous games in the series. There is still some jank with the parkour where your character feels like it doesn't follow where you want it to go which does lead to some frustrating scenarios which needs to be looked at in the next game. It looks really good to parkour but it feels like it always has been. The grappling hook is a really good addition though, swinging and scaling vertically make it a lot of fun to infiltrate a castle.

The overarching story [spoiler] feels like they want to move back towards the whole Isu/Desmond arc but there doesn't seem to be enough meat there yet for fans of that storyline. I was hoping to see Basim again. The roughly 40 hour personal story of Naoe and Yasuke however are enjoyable and put my initial skepticism to rest about the latter. It did feel a lot more serious in tone than previous titles, however that's not to say that the previous games were all rainbows and sunshine. I can see how some people might have an issue with how the story is spread throughout the game but there was enough in between with other plotlines that I did not find it to be an issue. I actually enjoyed both protagonists equally but would have preferred if it was still just one focus. [/spoiler]

The only bugs I've encountered are Naoe being invisible during one cutscene and guards resurrecting like they were Jesus Christ two seconds after I've stabbed them in the gut on occasion. Otherwise, I did not experience a single crash in my 100 hours playtime. Cutscenes are capped at 31 FPS and I see that as a problem even if the graphics do look maxed out during them.

It completely breaks the games pace and makes the lifeless characters and dialogue(s) even more wrenching to get through. When the load times actually aren't tremendously long and I don't get paused/black screened when I'm moving 20 ft in the direction I'm supposed to go in, I then face the problems previously mentioned (so far without fail). So, I skip the cutscenes whenever I can. And surprise!! Now there's no way to continue as there's no prompts to follow, the game will just pause and won't let me move ANYWHERE, and when I can I just have to run around until the next cutscene triggers UNLESS I'm prompted with the next task. Get this game at your own risk. Combats fun but very stiff, and stealth feels rigid. Hoping it gets better storywise and more playable in the future.",False,0,1,1743483872,76561198424738260,229

191696768,english,"Yasuke is completely and utterly out of place.

First and foremost, when I play a game set in feudal Japan I expect the main characters to be...you know, japanese.
I do not need a token black character who could have been substituted by any other samurai of that time period (there were plenty, and many of them with more lore and feats to boot).
His presence is the pinnacle of ""inserting characters only for 'Diversity'"", which works very poorly in a medieval japanese setting.

Also, the franchise has been always been about stealth and assassination (no exceptions in the previous games), why do you suddenly force the player to use a guy who cannot stealth, climb, leap, or do his job from the shadows?!
Playing Yasuke is basically: ""Move near enemy, hit 'attack' button until he falls, rinse and repeat"".
Even in hard difficulties completing missions with him is like a chore, since 99% of enemies fall like flies with minimal effort.

The sad fact is this game would have been stunning if the protagonist had been Naoe alone.
Playing her gives you a real AC experience, by climbing, hiding, using equipment to avoid engagements, and taking out only necessary targets.

Your 'inclusion' policy ruined the immersion of an otherwise masterwork game.

191695175,english,"Although I only finished Act 1, I will happily say this is a surprisingly good game, all things considered. 

QUICK REVIEW: [7/10] Game is good, not perfect, not great, good. It goes a fairly good job with both Yasuke and Naoe (the 2 characters you play as in the game). Gameplay is different than the other, newer, AC games over the past few years. AI is an improvement-ish. Story is good with a lot of buildup and twists. That's about it so far.

LONGER REVIEW:

I was super skeptical of the game considering all the massive hate that has accumulated around it via YT, twitter, reddit, etc., but if you ignore all the hate and just play the game, it's got a surprisingly good story, good gameplay, and surprisingly entertaining mechanics.

If you miss the older assassin's creed games that revolved heavily around stealth, assassinations, parkour, etc. this game is probably the best out of the past 4 games when it comes to the assassin's creed end. Stealth seems to lean pretty damn heavily with Naoe, assassinations feel satisfying, and parkour is...better... When it comes to mobility, movement, and parkour, it feels very much the same as Mirage/Valhalla (but faster), take that as you will. I feel like playing as Naoe, you REALLY have to rely on stealth and assassinations a large majority of the time. Obviously fighting enemies off is possible, but considering Naoe's low health pull and nearly tickle-able damage output, the game really does make you choose stealth as the suitable option rather than fighting off a fort of 3 dozen men like previous AC games.

If you enjoy Assassin's Creed RPG elements, Yasuke seems to be pretty big towards the ""fight, fight, and more fighting"" aspects of AC's newer games. He's a heavy hitter, blocking and dodging feel pretty good, abilities are flashy, you're a walking tank against most enemies, overall he's the brute in the game. I'm not a personal fan of Yasuke, but I can totally see how people could get around to playing him and enjoying him. 

THERE ARE MICROTRANSATIONS!!! Which sucks... but is totally not needed for gameplay. You can 100% go without putting a nickle into gameplay.

AI seems to have some improvements but also some down grades. Enemies definitely fight together fairly well in groups, I've noticed. Enemies also detect you very quickly, even when you're on top of buildings. Enemies attack much faster and blocks seem a lot more sturdy (at least when you're playing as Naoe).
However...enemies seem to just forget things super quick. What do I mean?! You can kill someone right infront of their buddy and their friend will completely forget you existed in a few seconds. 1 second they're ripping apart bushes, the next they're straight back to watching an empty wall. I know other AC games had similar AI functionality, but it does feel way more quicker than it used to. In previous games, at least from what I remember, it felt like enemies would at least wander around and maybe attract other soldier's attention. This game seems to be very ""Oh...my friend died, lemme check this 1 area...oh, nothing's there. Must've been the wind.""

As I stated above, I'm only on Act 1 and will probably update the review as time goes on...",True,0,0,1743476806,76561198128387047,1256

The world is absolutely breathtaking—I often find myself stopping just to admire the scenery. The combat, while a bit repetitive, remains enjoyable, and playing as Naoe makes parkour incredibly satisfying. It truly captures the essence of being a ninja in Feudal Japan. Yasuke is also very fun to play, although I much prefer Naoe.

I’ve been playing in immersive mode with one-hit assassinations enabled, and it genuinely feels like the way the game was meant to be experienced. The voice acting also shines in this mode, adding to the authenticity.

My only real gripe is the story structure. Since you can complete missions in any order, it’s easy to lose track of the narrative. Sometimes I’ll take down a target only to realize it was part of a quest I hadn’t even started, which can make important plot points feel sudden and disjointed.",True,0,1,1743473508,76561198067303799,1089

Initially I wasn't going to get this game because of all the controversy and bad publicity around it. But I decided to dive into the game for myself and stop listening to all the nonsense. I'm glad I did. Once I got into the game I couldn't put it down. The previous assassins creed games like Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, I eventually lost interest in them and never finished, but Shadows that wasn't the case. So for me at least, Assassins Creed Shadows is the best AC Ubi has come out with in a decade. The World looks amazing, the combat was improved from previous games and didn't feel repetitive, It felt engaging and satisfying, not as good as Ghost, but good enough to where I still enjoyed the fighting throughout my entire playthru. The story was a good 7/10 I would say. My only issue with the game was having two protagonists, which the game will make you play as both so you cant just choose one or the other but at least you can do most of all the open world side stuff as the one you prefer. Overall I'll give the game a 8.5/10. If it wasn't for being forced to play both protagonists I would rank the game higher.

191684059,english,"Alright I am a huge fan of Assassin's Creed, played the old games countless times.... Played all the recent entries too, loved my time playing them.

This game was just MEH. There's good things but there are a lot of bad things with some being super annoying. I cannot recommend this game to anyone at the current price UNLESS they are a die hard AC fan like me. For normal people just wait for a sale because overall this game is just mediocre.

I 100%ed the game, I put 73 hours into it. Steam may show lower hours like 46 but that's because apparently having steam in offline mode does not sync those hours played through uplay launcher.

Naoe is very fun to play, I loved getting her op and playing stealth with her most of the game. Shes agile and very quick at cutting down enemies silently and even in open conflict if good parry timings. Exploring with her is a pleasure too, she navigates every obstacle quickly and easily.

Yasuke is a goddamn tank who cuts everyone down super fast and its satisfying to fight as him. But that's it, only satisfying at fighting. Everything else is just bad from Yasuke, his dialogue, existence in the story, his clunkiness in running/ parkouring.... Like guys this is a AC game how can you have a character that cannot even climb properly or run at normal speed. Everything feels slow as him, and it was just annoying to be forced to swap to him a lot of the time to speak to npc's  or do the tombs when I was chilling exploring at my pace with Naoe just to be forced to slow down to this slow character for no reason.

Games like AC Syndicate and GTA5 have done multiple characters WAY better, AC Syndicate Jacob was totally  fine to parkour and explore with. Sure he was a slightly better fighter but it was balanced. AC Shadows is NOT balanced, and most of the character swapping is just there to waste time at this point. I wish it was more like a Witcher 3 way where Naoe is the main character like Geralt, and Yasuke was a side character that we could play occasionally like Ciri. But alas Ubi wants to push a black gay non binary samurai down our throats for no reason at the expense of the game.

Also I hate that some UI menus are so slow and wasting your time on purpose, biggest example is that stupid free battle pass in animus store. To claim each reward you have to claim them 1 by 1 with a massive lag spike and 10 seconds to claim each item 1 by 1. Why not have a claim all button????

Why does the smuggling feature have such a long and slow animation? Why does auto loot not just loot automatically instead of having to properly aim at 1 body to loot, most of the time its impossible to loot while running and looking else where spamming E, have to double back and aim properly to loot.

Why is the navigation with horses so bad, it bumps on objects randomly interrupting momentum.

Why is the LOOT in this game so underwhelming, after a point it was such a chore to even bother looting legendary chests because there is NOTHING useful in them.

Why are you selling the map and other stuff in the Helix store still? Do you not realize people buying the game at $80 just want to play and not fund your company further with micro-transactions. Thus nerfing all loot in game globally to tempt us to spend money? Respect your player base.

I wish you would go to the format of older games, and with characters like Naoe. Story focused with meaningful stealth. I would also like to see a conclusion to the real world events, its been a mess ever since ac3 ended and Desmond died.

I will go replay AC unity now because playing as Naoe just reminds me of the best parts of that game. This game could have been MUCH MUCH more. But it just ended up being a meh time pass experience.",False,0,0,1743462759,76561198136789922,2954

191683109,english,"Let me start off by saying Assassins Creed is my favorite game series. I have played every game multiple times over. What made me fall in love with Assassins Creed was not necessarily just the game play it was the awesome stories that unfolded in each game and through consecutive games. Now that we have set the stage lets talk about Shadows:

Pros: 
Best game mechanics since the introduction of the RPG elements in Origins. I wasn't a huge fan of the change and combat but in this game it felt like I had more freedom in fights and more options and approaches to take on equipment. The stealth mechanics is the best out of all Assassins Creed if you play on highest difficulty (I recommend you do this or this game is a walk in the park).

The game is stunning. Exploring different parts of the map didn't seem as much as a chore since you got to look at this world from different views.

Playing as Noae was really fun. Exactly how I want my assassins creed play through to go. Excellent stealth and not way to powerful in fights but good based on build and skill. 

Everything in the skill tree is viable for different builds.

Love the main base. ALL upgrades are meaningful and its not a ridiculous amount of buildings. I upgraded and built them all by the end of the game by just clearing forts during main or side quests. Truthfully if we get more Assassins Creed games (which I really hope so, I dont want it to end like this) I hope they keep the main base mechanics just like this.

Cons: 
The story for this game is the absolute worst in all the assassins creed games. This game wanted to do some many things and half assed all of them. The game is so long but even when you get to the ending it is so anti climatic that you feel as though there is going to be a Shadows 2. They could of done so much with this game and it really fell flat in all aspects story wise.

Playing as Yaske is playing the game on easy mode. Yaske takes 0 skill, just mash attack with the occasional skill/parry. Don't even get me started on how he cant parcore or stealth. Like what is the point of this type of character in an assassins game. If this was a different game without the assassins creed title whatever but come on. Yaske feels forced into this story and honestly should of been a naoe only game. Putting the whole political issue aside, if they made Yaske make sense, I wouldn't have cared but man is he forced. If you play this game play with noae as much as possible.

Equipment is not balanced. I am not one to go for over powered builds or search for them but man, its hard not to find them. I found a build where it was literally impossible for an enemy to attack me with noae. Easiest boss fights of my life.

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to many targets. I got so bored of going after the side targets half way through the game. Way to many of them.

Don't play in English. The Japanese accents are really bad to the point its like racism LOL.

Overall Thoughts:
I am going to not recommend this game purely based on price. This game is not the best but also not the worst. If you can get this game half off and as long as you dont care about the story this game is alright. If you got free time to kill and its cheap, sure go for it. If your looking for the next big hit, keep it moving.",False,0,2,1743461719,76561198325419399,3586

191680162,english,"Let’s start with the positives, this game is a technical marvel. Ubisoft’s engine manages to bring feudal Japan to life with breathtaking detail, riding through the landscapes is a visual feast, and the studio’s talent for world-building is, as always, perfect. The dynamic weather and season system is also a hit. Storms come in and out with cinematic weight, while the map undergoes drastic seasonal transformations, watching feudal Japan shift from cherry-blossom spring to vibrant orange autumn forests is nothing short of amazing. The combat system is another massive improvement, its the best it has ever been since the shift to RPG mechanics.

Now, the flaws.

While the world is stunning, exploration feels hollow. Besides the large outposts, there’s little incentive to engage with the environment. Smaller side activities, designed to get mastery points for skill-tree progression, quickly devolve into tedious chores, forcing players to grind just to be able to get newer abilities.

The loot system is a fundamental misfire. In Odyssey, progression felt rewarding: starting with basic gray gear and gradually earning rare, powerful items created a satisfying power curve. Shadows, however, repeats Valhalla’s mistakes. Though Ubisoft reintroduced lower-rarity loot in chests, the system collapses early. After clearing your first outpost, you’re handed legendary gear, which incentivizes you to stick with it, leading to upgrading said gear becoming the only option.

Mid-game, this flaw becomes unbearable. With two protagonists, one wielding three and the other five weapon types, loot distribution becomes chaotic. The minimal filler gear you find (only in specific chests, not enemy drops) is spread thin across twelve equipment slots, making relying on random filler loot drops for new gear impossible. By the late game, you’re forced to either grind for materials or stick with underpowered gear. For an RPG, this is catastrophic—loot should motivate progression, not smother it.


The narrative is the game’s biggest sin. It borrowed Valhalla’s non-linear structure, the plot tasks you with assassinating 12 targets in any order. While the Japanese voice acting is amazing and the opening hours are the best narrative assasin's creed has had since AC Origins, the structure kills the momentum. Characters can’t evolve meaningfully when quests are self-contained. For example, Yasuke’s potential arc, like one of struggling with his morality, is impossible to acomplish because the game can’t account for player choice. Making the narrative a disjointed story that feels like a checklist.

I wanted to love Shadows, AC Odyssey is my favorite assain's creed, but even though the world and combat show flashes of brilliance, the flawed progression and lifeless story overshadow its strengths. Ubisoft’s half-hearted commitment to RPG mechanics leaves the game stranded between identities, no proper mechanics for an rpg and too disjointed for people that enjoy strong narratives. Ubisoft HAS to rethink their approach.

Since im a biased AC consumer i will give it a 7/10, but for a normal gamer that's just looking for good narratives you will be better suited elsewhere ",False,0,16,1743458371,76561198220172689,3463

191676902,english,"This is, in my opinion, the best game in the Assassin's Creed franchise, managing to be very good from every angle -- gameplay, story, and visuals.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
As someone who hasn't enjoyed an AC game since Syndicate, the gameplay in this one just clicked for me in a way that all the games from the past decade haven't. The stealth is good, if a bit too easy. Assassinations are well-balanced, requiring a little building into for the strongest foes, but still instant kills on most enemies. The combat is great, and the RPG elements felt much less frustratingly out of place. Yasuke is not your typical AC protagonist, but he's something new and interesting, and his gameplay feels mostly great, actually.

[h3]Story / quests / writing[/h3]
The protagonists are amazing and most of the supporting cast are also great. The quests and story are good, and while there is a lot of it, it doesn't feel like it trades quality for quantity. I highly recommend playing on canon mode to get the best experience. Canon mode also (from what I've heard) gets rid of worst dialog options in the game, those being the romance-related ones.

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
The world is absolutely gorgeous, and I also can't help but stare at Yasuke's face. At 4K max quality settings, this is the first game that I feel genuinely approaches photorealism. It's the first photorealistic-style game where I can say that every frame looks like a piece of art. This game basically single-handedly turned me from a raytracing skeptic into a raytracing believer. The dynamic weather and seasons are awesome systems that make the world come alive in a way that no other game has managed. All this comes at a hefty cost, though. I will say, however, that this is the first game in many years to make me give up a steady 60 fps just to crank the eye-candy up.

[h3]Issues[/h3]
There are a few technical issues with the game, but I am hoping that those will get patched soon. Primarily, the music, voice lines, and some ambient sounds will stop playing for up to a minute at a time, then all play at once. This also seems to be connected to a level-of-detail switching issue, where I am sometimes able to get all the way through a town on horseback before the high-quality textures and models load in (at the same time as the sounds resume). Additionally, cutscenes are capped to 31 FPS, have really bad clothing physics that spazzes out all over the place, and sometimes have extremely bright spotlights on characters at weird angles.

My specs for reference:
Ryzen 7 7800X3D
RTX 4090
NVME SSD in the slot that connects directly to the CPU without going through the chipset
96GB 6000 MT/s CL30 RAM

I hate that the game has microtransactions and time-limited challenges for currency. If I pay $70 for a game, I expect to be able to play the game at my pace and unlock all the content, given that I have the necessary skill. I will never pay extra for any of these things out of principle.

[h3]Misc[/h3]
My play-through was close to 100%, but I didn't bother with most of the busy-work completionist quests. It ended up taking me about 80 hours of actual playtime to complete.

The music was really good.

191672062,english,"I think its pretty good. Stealth is really great, and the combat is a lot better than the other games (still room for more depth and improvement, more kill animations needed and more stances or moves per weapon). World is just stunning on a good rig. Weather system, season system, new stealth systems (like shadows, grappling hook, stealth animations, can get spotted on roofs, creeping underwater with a bamboo straw), and seasons affecting stealth tactics (icicles on roofs, snow removes foliage, water freezes, fog visibility, sound masked in rain, shadows at night) etc are truly incredible. 

Some side filler content namely fetching collectables or mini games is very boring and uninspired, ghost of tsushima did this way, way better. I liked the story, a lot in some parts, but wouldn't call it amazing. Open world just lacks the sort of unique random encounters ala RDR2 or GoT, that aren't a marker on a map. The sort of things that make you want to explore every nook to see something unique are not here. That said, the open world and the animations of NPCs just doing stuff is pretty good, so I still enjoyed exploring and walking throughout the towns.

I enjoyed the gear system & legendary perks system. A lot of perks and build variety it looks like. That said, some cool perks are tied to the ingame shop items. I believe there is a way to earn these in game, I just couldnt tell you how long that would take. If they are giving the DLC free, this is how they have chosen to monetise it.

191670864,english,"If you liked AC: Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla--or even one or two of those--you will probably like AC: Shadows. The game is a natural evolution of the things in those earlier titles, resulting in a game that is familiar in its basic design and mechanics with elevated  overall world-building and visual appeal. The visuals (4070S/1440p here) are gorgeous, and the animations and textures and VFX extremely well executed. The audio is also excellent (I recommend playing with Japanese/Portuguese spoken word with the subtitles in your native language). 

Shadows has a couple of ""hooks"" that give it some of its own character. One is the setting; 16th century Japan is wicked cool. Another is the dual character system. You first play as Naoe, a more typical sneaky-stabby AC archetype, and then unlock Yasuke, a big (really big, like, he towers over most of the locals) samurai bull-in-a-china-shop sort of dude. Each character feels very different, and you may find yourself preferring one over the other, but they are both quite entertaining in their own ways. Just moving around as Yasuke feels so much different than moving as Naoe, and combat is as different as well.

Flaws? Sure, most of them typical of this sort of sprawling open-world game. Quest/mission quality is uneven, though IMO pretty solid most of the time. There's a lot of walking, riding, boating, and swimming, which is either a plus or a minus depending on your preferences. There is the full spectrum of Ubi-things, from climbing structures to gathering materials to upgrading gear, plus of course the ubi-quitous (heh) shop full of in-game mostly cosmetic items you can buy for Ubi-bucks or whatever, some of which you can get in-game but there's always the option to buy for real too.

Contrary to what a lot of video reviews seem to believe, there is no such thing as a perfect game, and this one has its rough edges as well. The stealth/vision system, like all such systems, has its oddities. Depending on your gear, the terrain, and the time of day and what-not, you can find yourself right next to people who don't seem to know you are there. Guards sometimes seem to have really bad eyesight, as well. You will occasionally get stuck on things, though not nearly as often as in earlier games, and the combinations of lighting, clothing, and animations are so extensive that you are bound to once in a while come across some bizarre stuff. Add in the usual bugs, like dead dudes not staying dead, that you will find in most of these huge games, and yeah, there are occasional glitches.

But overall, it's a hoot. The world is beautiful, the characters I think are likable, the story is...fine, but then, I tend towards mechanics more than story myself, so YMMV. Well worth the asking price if you ask me.

Oh, and ignore all the faux-outrage over ""realism"" or whatever. It's a game series with pre-human aliens, godlike entities spanning thousands of years, weird-ass science experiments, and magic doo-dads.

For a series that's from 2007, and went through a reboot in 2017, I guess I expected ""more""? What you get is rather polished. But it seems like the systems they introduced are all regressions from previous iterations holding it back.

- The two split characters feels like a step backwards, especially since I don't understand why you'd play an AC title and not want to be the stealthy boi.
- Too much foilage. Not clear where you go. Areas look kind of the same everywhere. So do the enemies.
- Cannot open legendary chest until you complete all objectives.
- No quicksave/quickload function kind of hinders difficulty. You play on an easier mode than you want because reloading takes forever and makes you lose a lot of progress.
- Unrealistic architecture.  Big castle. Protected by water and walls.  Nobody look at the big tree overhanging it convieniently.

What gets an up:
- The setting and the map for this entry is incredible. Seemed like a massive oversight for AC to have missed Japan so far, but Shadows makes up for it.
- The combat is S-tier, a nice smash between old and new ACs, and incredibly satisfying. 
- Stealth (on expert) is a fun challenge, but they don't make it a succeed or die thing.
- Graphics are stunning. Got consistently solid framerates at high settings on a 6700XT.
- With AC, there's always the chance you get lumbered with some unlikable protagonists. Not here - Naoe is the best fit for an AC protagonist in a long while. Yasuke sticks out like a sore thumb at first, but quickly found myself warming to him. He's a bland babyface type, but he makes up for it in raw carnage.

What gets a down:
- Story was so so. The end had a couple of big reveals where I just went ""well if you said that at the start, maybe I'd have been more invested in the characters."" It does the job I suppose, but hardly something I'll remember until my dying days.
- The gear situation. Don't get me wrong, there's some great builds to make (Naoe with Bloodletter rinses everything, give Yasuke the biggest stick you can find). Where it falls down is the levelling. Only times I went back to HQ was to upgrade my gear every level, which gets progressively more of a pain in the arse as you level. This is what caused me to finish the game early without a bunch of side quests because I simply couldn't be arsed.
- More broadly, the whole RPG elements here. Love RPGs, but this is all superfluous to the experience here. 
- The generate-a-quest stuff you get from your mini bases are boring and grindy. 

Overall, 8.5/10. Played the ever loving shit out of it, got my money's worth, had a great time.",True,0,0,1743438963,76561197998048741,4731
191658768,english,"[h1]Assassin's Creed Shadows: A Comprehensive Critique[/h1]

As some people have pointed out, I only have 1 hour of gameplay on Steam. I refunded the game here and bought a cheap key that I activated on Ubisoft Connect, hence the short playtime here.

I played the game with the Japanese/Portuguese VA (immersive or whatever it was called), with Stealth and Combat difficulty to expert (max difficulty). I didn't finish the game, probably never will, but played a good 40 hours.

[h3]Visual and Environmental Design[/h3]
Assassin's Creed Shadows delivers impressively on the visual front. The game's ambient design creates an immersive world with notable attention to detail, particularly in the weather system. The wind simulation deserves special recognition, with leaves flowing naturally across landscapes creating a truly dynamic environment.
However, the wildlife implementation feels underdeveloped. Animals appear to exist as mere aesthetic additions rather than integral parts of the ecosystem. The AI governing wildlife behavior is rudimentary at best, with particularly noticeable issues in bird behaviors which abruptly despawn when observed closely, breaking immersion in what is otherwise a visually compelling world.

[h3]Open World Design[/h3]
The open world of Assassin's Creed Shadows quickly becomes tedious despite its visual appeal. The game follows the standard open-world formula that has become all too familiar in the gaming industry - a large map populated with repetitive activities, collectibles, and cookie-cutter side quests. There's little innovation in how players interact with this world, resulting in an experience that feels recycled rather than refreshed.
The map offers beautiful vistas but lacks meaningful discovery or emergent gameplay opportunities that would encourage genuine exploration. Instead, players are guided by the usual array of map markers and checklist activities that have defined open-world games for the past decade. Perhaps the most egregious missed opportunity lies in the game's Eagle Vision mechanic, which highlights interactive elements with blue dots that typically only lead to overheard conversations with no meaningful follow-up. This represents a critical failure to capitalize on what could have been a rich system for player engagement. Unlike games such as Fallout: New Vegas, where the world reveals interconnected relationships and spawn meaningful side quests, Shadows' conversations remain isolated and inconsequential. Players are left frustrated by the promise of interaction that never materializes, when the game could have used these moments to develop characters, unveil new storylines, or create a more dynamic and responsive world where NPCs feel genuinely connected to one another. The kill/spare system could've also been much more meaningful, but I won't expand on it. For those who aren't already enthusiasts of the genre, this approach feels particularly stale and fails to justify the expansive world the developers have created. The game seems content to rely on established design patterns rather than pushing the boundaries of what an open world can offer.

[h3]Traversal Mechanics[/h3]
The parkour system, a staple of the Assassin's Creed franchise, performs adequately but lacks the fluidity one might hope for. While movement can feel rewarding when executed properly, certain scenarios become unnecessarily challenging due to control inconsistencies.
The introduction of the grappling hook represents a missed opportunity. While it adds a new dimension to traversal, its implementation feels limited and underutilized. The tool could have revolutionized movement throughout the game but instead serves as an occasional convenience rather than a transformative gameplay element.

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
Combat represents one of the game's weakest aspects. The system lacks depth and sophistication, often devolving into ability-spamming once cooldowns reset. The flow between different combat actions feels disjointed, particularly evident in the handling of throwable weapons. The game's decision to lock throwable inputs during attack animations prevents players from creating smooth combat combinations, resulting in a staccato fighting experience.
The limited variety of finisher animations becomes repetitive early in the gameplay experience, further emphasizing the combat system's shallow design. Enemy AI during combat scenarios displays basic patterns that pale in comparison to the sophisticated enemy behaviors found in FromSoftware titles for example. The attempt to emulate that style of combat falls noticeably short.
The difficulty scaling presents another significant issue. Higher difficulty settings don't create more intelligent or tactically challenging enemies; instead, they simply reduce player health while inflating enemy health pools. This approach creates artificial rather than meaningful difficulty, resulting in less engaging and rewarding combat encounters.

[h3]Stealth Mechanics[/h3]
The stealth system in Assassin's Creed Shadows presents a mixed experience that undermines consistent gameplay. On expert difficulty, the AI detection can be frustratingly inconsistent. Guards sometimes spot you almost instantaneously when traversing rooftops, making what should be a ninja's natural domain surprisingly restrictive. This overly sensitive detection creates tedious trial-and-error sequences that interrupt the flow of gameplay. Conversely, the same AI can display baffling obliviousness in other scenarios, with guards failing to react to assassinations happening mere meters away. On a side note, kudos to the ""dynamic"" stealth system. Obviously at night, you can stealth easily, and even more by staying in the shadows. But it makes stealth in the day very limited. All these inconsistencies makes it difficult to develop reliable stealth strategies and diminishes what could have been a standout feature in a game set in feudal Japan.

[h3]Narrative[/h3]
The narrative has its moments of brilliance that stand out from the overall story. Certain scenes and character interactions succeed in creating memorable experiences that briefly elevate the gameplay. However, these high points are isolated within an otherwise unremarkable storyline that fails to maintain consistent quality or emotional impact throughout the experience. The potential for a truly engaging narrative is evident in these stronger moments, making the overall mediocrity of the story all the more disappointing.

[h3]Monetization Practices[/h3]
The implementation of a cash shop and battle pass system represents one of the most disappointing aspects of Assassin's Creed Shadows. In a full-priced AAA title, locking cosmetic content behind additional paywalls feels exploitative rather than supportive of the player experience. While cosmetic rewards earned through gameplay challenges could have provided meaningful progression and extended engagement with the game world, the decision to gate these items behind timed availability and additional purchases is simply shameful. This approach prioritizes additional revenue streams over player satisfaction and stands in stark contrast to the artistic ambitions displayed in the game's environmental design. The monetization strategy ultimately tarnishes what goodwill the game manages to build through its stronger elements.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Assassin's Creed Shadows presents a visually striking world with impressive environmental details. However, the game struggles with underdeveloped AI, a formulaic open world design, merely adequate parkour mechanics, underutilized traversal innovations, and a particularly disappointing combat system that lacks fluidity and depth. Combined with a narrative that shows flashes of promise but ultimately underwhelms, these shortcomings result in a mediocre gaming experience that fails to fully capitalize on its promising elements.",False,0,1,1743438412,76561198027580021,69

Game looks amazing, with all the lighting, detail, season changes and patricles (leaves, rain and snow). Performance is good too, well in line with what you see on the screen. Barely any bugs.

Side quests are awful. All those cool story driven quests you could find in Odyssey, with memorable characters you could meet again and again - gone. Barely any side quests get any story beyond ""those guys bad, please kill them"" and getting another ""circle"" with enemies to kill added to your journal. Or worse - a kill count, like ""kill 50 bandits"". In addition to that, you can often meet quest enemies before you get the quest and the game won't account for it.

191637958,english,"You won't like this game if you prefer linear / sandbox / limited open world Assassin's Creed games. As it happens, I like open world RPG games; which is probably why I liked this one! Ubisoft Quebec developed both Shadows and Odyssey, and the latter is my second favorite game ever (after Skyrim lul), so nobody's surprised that this has happened.

Here are some interesting gameplay observations, of both the positive and the negative variety:

> The elephant in the room - microtransactions. Y'all need to calm down. If you are incapable of accepting that they exist, or (more likely) if you're incapable of not buying stuff even though you don't want to, then yeah: spend your time being upset about them. I have not found them to be invasive to gameplay, they don't gate anything, just because P2W is available does not mean I have a dying wish to partake.

> Stop forgetting your passwords and the Ubisoft launcher won't be a problem. This is a skill issue.

> Do not traverse the wilderness. If you love open world RPGs, you'll want to, but just don't do it. First of all, it's nearly impossible. You'll spend a lot of time on the road looking at the bushes, next moment you're in the bushes looking at more bushes. If they put a hill in your way that you can't scramble up using your limited parkour skills, they don't want you to go that way. Second of all, it is completely pointless. You won't run into any interesting things you'd otherwise not find by making your way (by road) to the undiscovered locations.

> If you do decide to attempt to traverse the wilderness, you'll be hearing a lot of random grunts and near-screeches. At first you will feel afraid, but there is nothing that can harm you in the wilderness. I'm pretty sure the noises you hear is some type of sad deer. Maybe a boar.

> You can pet cats and dogs and take them home with you, so this is basically GOTY.

> At home, you can build yourself a base. Placing things is incredibly unpolished and annoying, but it grows on you. Personally I've filled it with cats.

> There's a handful of quicktime events, if you go outta your way to find them. You won't be panicking mid-cutscene because you suddenly have to press X to doubt, but you'll be practicing your kata or finding a nice shrine to pray at, and they'll make you do a sequence of QTEs. It could be worse.

> The game is absolutely beautiful. There's fields and water and sakura trees and forest (bushes included) and little villages and Ubisoft hasn't abandoned photo mode.

> The stealth is fairly decent, the combat is *okay*, the combo kill animations are exactly what you'd expect. NPC behavior is kinda boring though. These boys were more alive in AC: Odyssey, but I did hear one NPC yell ""I'm in love with your sister! There, I said it!"" to another, so the dramatics are there if you look for them.

> Parkour (especially if you try to traverse the wilderness) could be better. Remember in the first Assassin's Creed game when you begged Altaïr to not turn around and launch himself off the building to his death? Naoe sometimes wants to do exactly that. She wiggles in places you don't want her to, grabs ladders out of turn, refuses to climb a 2 meter wall while being chased by 19,000 guards and doesn't listen when you want her to carefully climb down a ledge and instead launches herself off it into the bushes. On the upside, she does have a little grappling hook winchy thing, which she is very willing to use, and perfectly demonstrates upper body strength she should not actually possess.

> Yasuke is a big man, Naoe is a little girl. If you prefer one over the other, you'll be pleased to know that you'll be forced into the one you don't like fairly rarely. Sort of. Compared to AC: Syndicate for example, you won't groan loudly when they force you onto a character for hours on end.

> 35 hours of fannying about, I have made one lover. Kassandra made her first lover within 30 minutes of starting the game. However, if you ever chose to romance Yennefer in The Witcher 3, you will be pleased with the scene that followed meeting said lover. :)

> You can force the season to change, but you cannot change time from night to day. You'll experience being lost in the wilderness on a winter night (it's dark out there), slowly struggling through deep snow (which you shouldn't be doing because traversing the wilderness is even more horrible in the winter), listening to weird animal groans. But snow will stick to your clothing, which is a level of immersion I wasn't expecting.

> People seem to hate the story, but I've cried. Twice. The main story cutscenes are **LONG** though. Incredibly long, and they rarely ask you your opinion on what they're talking about. Settle in and grab the popcorn, Naoe is about to have another meltdown about how unfair the world is. I'd agree though that the facial animations could use some work, but if you've played any game ever they're not wildly offensive, I'm not that bothered by it.

191626243,english,"Expectations before the release were quite low due to the ongoing discussions about the game, which had drained any remaining hope for Ubisoft.

After 30 hours of gameplay, here are a few key takeaways:

1) Locations and Nature: The game does a fantastic job of showcasing Japanese culture, capturing the intricacies of ornamentation and the differences between temples (even if they may seem similar at first glance, they are not).
2) Music and Atmosphere: The musical direction is hard to overlook—it greatly enhances the atmosphere, especially in various scenes and mini-quests. 

The ambiance of each province in the game is simply incredible, offering a stunning visual experience.

Out of all the Assassin’s games I’ve played, this one feels the most refined in terms of stealth mechanics. The fact that falling icicles can trigger enemies is a particularly nice touch.

In my opinion, Yasuke’s story feels more fleshed out than Naoe’s—the writers delve deeper into his character, making his journey more engaging.

Many romances in the game feel empty and unnecessary, seemingly added just for the “illusion of choice,” as if they would have any real impact on the story.

Despite having no expectations for the game, it turned out to be a surprise. Wait for a discount and give it a try! :)

Pros
-The world looks amazing on ultra in 1080p and i can imagine it is even better in 4k. The grass flows with the wind and guess what so do peoples hair. The trees are simple but elegant. The water physics may not be the best out there but with how little time you spend in or on water in this game they are more than worthy. 
-The different seasons each look good and make you adjust for it. Also they look pretty and yes, seeing a tree with different color leaves or blossoming is just a pretty sight to me. It is the simple things in life.
-The combat feels fun and rewarding whether you play as either protag. The different weapon choices each one has gives you freedom to find the right niche for your style of play. 
-Naoe's stealth and movement are wonderful, she flows around the map with ease. The parkour in an AC game has not felt this good in a very long time. Add in her grappling hook and it is just icing on the cake.
-The voice acting in English is no where near as bad as people make it out to be, but the Japanese is really good!
-There is so much to do, it took me 20+ hours to finish act one because i just got lost exploring the world.

Cons
-Once you get proficient at combat and start getting skills the game starts to feel really easy. Good news there is difficulty settings to fix this.
-The sheer amount of quick time event side quests is annoying. (Something about this later on)
-Some of the things i want to do with the hideout building it will not allow me to do even though realistically it should. (kinda a weird gripe but i like building mechanics like these)
-The story gets lost in the world because there is a lot going on. The story is not bad it just feels like unless you just do the story you kinda lose track of it.

Things that annoy me that they made a workaround for
-Quick time events man, i am a person who despises them. Good news if you are like me they have a setting that makes all quick time events auto complete which is a blessing.
-The fact that i have to go into my settings to make auto assassinations a thing. Like i am glad you put it there but come on, it is a game about sneaking around and one shotting the bad guy with a blade to the neck.

Yasuke (yes he gets his own section, get over it)
-He feels out of place in a game that could have been a return to form
-His combat is great, i enjoy playing as him just for his combat. It is fluid, powerful and he is highly effective.
-His concentration vision as opposed to Naoe's eagle vision is far superior. You can run around full speed and even use it on horseback while moving. Something Naoe cannot do which is weird if you ask me.
-Yes his parkour is bad, but the dude is meant the be the brute force to Naoe's elegance so it fits as far as giving all people their choice of play style which is great. What actually gave me a laugh and made me think was his parkour feels like playing AC 1 with Altair as a kid. 
-This last one is just a personal thing, his running animation is clunky and awkward AF and it feels wrong and out of place for me, but i have gotten over it do to how much fun it is to charge a castle and just take on waves on enemies.
-Yea i said that was the last one but if your gripe is the male on male romance.... the game allows your to chose, so if you chose it and hate it (which i have not) that's on you.

Look the game is not a perfect game and no game is. Will it have bugs? Yes. Will it have issues? Yes. But in my opinion is it worth buying? 100% it is, this is a game you can easily sink 100+ hours into without even thinking about it. I paid full price for this game when i told myself i would wait because of how many people were talking bad about it. I would say they are wrong but thats up to you to find out for yourself. If you want to wait until it goes on sale, more power to you. Take everything i have said with a grain of salt because we are different people with different minds and interests. Don't discard the thought of this game just because some streamer/youtuber did. A lot of people poured their hearts and souls into this project and it shows. So to them i say thank you for the 40+ hours i have spent playing and for so many more to come.

191621733,english,"I 100% recommend this game to people who like AC and have time to enjoy a game without complaining. I don't know why people don't like the story; to be honest, it's a video game, and it's a soft real-life history twisted to fit in the AC world. Noae is all I've been playing at this current review, and the exploration and separation are surprising. I don't know if the game forces you to play as Yasake, but I wouldn't mind seeing his side of the story. Just remember, this is not correct, but the locations and the overall picture of the not-AC story that is being told are pretty well laid out. Noae and Yasake are fictional characters made to add the AC elements in the game. Yes, it could be better, but it is blending well (the Noae side, I can't speak on the Yasake side yet). 

THE MICRO-TRANSACTIONS:
They do suck but AC was literately one of the first games to ever put them in a video game, and they are not forced but they are there. They do have a system where you can earn keys by exploring and playing the game to unlock rotational items that are being sold for the premium currency. I have not noticed a cap on keys you can earn, but I see it as a positive that they at least have a rotational store with things you can earn without spending real money. ALSO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANYTHING IN THE GAMES STORE, IT'S JUST COSMETICS (They are a company at the end of the day). 

MY RANT: 
AC has never been historically accurate, and the game's conclusion always mimics real life with an AC twist. Every year, people complain about this. This isn't Snow White of 2025, so I recommend playing it. This does cater to two different fans of the franchises: the assassin and the brute. It's unique, and I'm enjoying it. Combat to me is very easy in the game, and the RPG mechanics of the game make it so that I can form the combat around my play style. I am enjoying the game, and it is not the best AC game I've ever played, but it is a good one. The environment and landscape are amazing (even though I think they added too many wild animals I can't kill running around), it makes the exploration feel good. There are repetitive buildings, but the layout of compounds and strongholds keeps it fresh. To me, this is a well-designed game, and it does show that AC can still make improvements on their characters while putting them in historical events. THIS IS A BLEND OF FICTION AND NONFICTION. I won't compare this to other games inspired by the same theme because it is an AC game, not anything else.",True,0,0,1743394759,76561198277518572,1190

     but really... I like the game... waited forever for this version.. I'm glad its selling well, i knew it would even if it had been game one... Micro transactions are not some sort of pay-to-win part of the game, they are completely optional and 90% cosmetic. Ya they add a few buffs, one of them cloaks you if sitting still for 2 seconds... a bit OP when mixed with whistle distraction... but I'm actually glad its a cosmetic/add on option as if it was base game it would be the go to and would feel ... i guess cheap is the word... People are complaining about the plot and voice acting... I think they are OK most of the time... the plot seems a bit simple but it worked for me... the voice acting is fine in my opinion... there's a few times it felt off... but nothing that hurt the game for me. The one thing that concerned me is that it didn't appear to have the counter kills i loved from the other games. But come to find out you do get it later, i haven't unlocked it yet so hopefully it gives me somewhat of the same feel as previous games. I really liked AC brotherhood so I will hopefully be feeling that a bit in future game play. The environment is pretty and I like it a lot, castles and wilderness are just what I hoped for. The game hasn't glitched or crashed for me, although, judging from appearance I can see that its probably pretty heavy on the system requirements, so if your computer isn't great you probably wont have a great experience and performance and crashing issues. As far as the negative reviews you see go, I don't really agree with most of them, the micro transactions are not needed to enjoy the game at its full potential, the plot and voice acting are fine as far as I'm concerned, I feel like people are getting their expectations a little over board these days, there are some people who just wont be happy with anything they see.

So I bought it and it is now my favorite AC game after Black Flag. Naoe feels absolutely phenomenal to play with the upgraded stealth mechanics. She really feels like a shinobi ninja. Yasuke's story is good but I don't prefer playing as him due to his limitations on exploring even though he is a tank in combat. The best part of the game after the stealth mechanics is the setting. The Japanese setting the devs created is absolutely beautiful. The devs really cooked with the graphics and the immersive Japanese time period. A lot of reviews complain about the story, but I am playing in immersive mode and the Japanese voice actors all did such a good job I am vibing with the story much more because of it. Highly recommend immersive mode. The game is great but not perfect. My biggest complaint is that the world is just too damn big. Ubisoft needs to cool it big time on world size. It doesn't need to be nearly as big as it is. Overall one of the best AC games imo. Give it a shot if you are on the fence.

191618640,english,"So, I’ll be honest: I wasn’t planning to care about this game. The last AC I played was Valhalla, and I didn’t even finish it. It dragged on forever, and somewhere between raiding the hundredth village and building up my camp again, I lost interest. It wasn’t a bad game, but it wasn’t for me.
But Shadows? Yeah, this one’s clicking.

First, the setting is just beautiful. Japan looks incredible in this game. Forests, castles, and rainy nights feel super atmospheric without trying too hard. I actually want to explore again, not just because there’s a marker on the map but because the world feels interesting.

The dual characters of Naoe and Yasuke work are way better than I expected. Naoe’s stealth gameplay scratches that itch I’ve missed from the older AC games, and Yasuke brings the heavy-hitting, samurai-style combat that feels super satisfying without being overly complicated. It’s a nice switch-up when one playstyle starts getting a bit stale.

The pacing’s also better. I don’t need to grind 20 side quests to level up or unlock the next story mission. I can… play. That alone makes a huge difference.
It’s not a perfect game. There are some clunky moments here and there, but compared to how Valhalla felt like a chore at times, Shadows feels way more enjoyable and way less exhausting.

Love that they removed being able to climb absolutely every wall and rock, you actually have to try to find paths like the pre rpg games. Combat feels nice when you're within 3-4 levels of the opponents but past that theyre kinda damage sponges.
One of my biggest concerns before trying it out was being forced to play as one character or the other for parts of the game. but after act 1 it's surprising how much freedom you have to play as either Naoe or Yasuke.

Goes straight away to a generic 'kill those 11 whatever, however"" . Each one has a story line before you kill them, 4-5 short missions, missions that got nothing to do with the actually person ur chasing but somehow after the 3-4 missions of kill this and go there the final target appears to be killed in a much more well designed mission. Its easy to see how ubisoft is choosing quantity over quality. Its just straight 100+ hours of do the same 5 things over and over. At least the money its worth i guess....
After you kill the 11 targets, witch was the purpose of the game in the beginning, the characters and the game forgets to care and u just move on to do the rest, no credits no cut scene about it, just do the rest of the map!!!
Idk,,,its a game thats just there, if you got nothing to spend money on get it because u can easily waste 200h in it (all tho all the content is 10h) .

191609995,english,"I wanted to like this game. I said it was going to suck when its original release date was still in November 2024. The repeated delays only reinforced that idea in my head. In a way, after all of its recent failings—and there have been [i]a lot[/i] of those—Ubisoft was almost the underdog when releasing [i]Assassin’s Creed Shadows[/i]. The company needed a huge win, and with the desperation they [i]should[/i] have been feeling, I was willing to give [i]Shadows[/i] an honest try. Boy, it sure would have been nice for Ubisoft to have proven me wrong when I said it was going to suck. 

The funny thing about [i]Shadows[/i] is that it simultaneously has the core to be the best “assassin” [i]Assassin’s Creed’s[/i] game since [i]AC2[/i], while also being the pinnacle of uninspired Ubisoft slop—Ubislop?—and easily the worst game I will play this year. If this game does not end up at the bottom of my game rankings at the end of the year, I will personally write a letter to Yves Guillemot explaining in great detail why Ubisoft is actually the greatest video game company around and why he’s the best CEO that has ever existed. 

And no, I don’t care that the gameplay is functionally ""fine"". I don't care that it’s better than [i]Valhalla[/i]. [i]Valhalla[/i] sucked and was a miserable slog, so [i]Shadows[/i] being [i]marginally[/i] better because its environment looks nicer and the stealth kind of matters don't give it a pass anymore, and the bar to clear should have been higher anyway. Yves said that making good, “solid” games isn’t enough anymore. Well, [i]Shadows[/i] isn’t even solid, so where the hell does that leave the state of Ubisoft games? [i]Star Wars Outlaws[/i] sucked, [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] has largely sucked for a decade, [i]Skull and Bones[/i] sucked, [i]Far Cry[/i] hasn’t been good since 2012, and [i]Watch Dogs[/i] has never been good. Ubisoft has [i]nothing[/i] to hang its hat on outside of possibly [i]The Lost Crown[/i]. It is baffling how much this company sucks at doing its job. 

Before I pile on [i]Shadows[/i] too much—because there is a lot wrong with this game—I’ll touch on its one good aspect. On its Expert Mode, playing as Naoe is largely enjoyable. The stealth is harder to pull off, which makes the combat threatening if you mess it up, and coupled with massive, sprawling castles and fort maps that are filled with dozens of enemies, it is the closest to feeling like a sneaky assassin that this series has been able to touch in ages. If this game was cut down to Naoe’s gameplay, a handful of the castles and forts, and no useless open world, this game would have been good. 

But we can’t have that, apparently. [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] just can’t quit the awful open-world design. The series also can't quit doing a poor job of copying [i]The Witcher III[/i]'s gameplay, a decision that was running thin around the time [i]Odyssey[/i] came out. Sure, the world is pretty, but games don’t get points for that anymore, especially when [i]Ghost of Tsushima[/i] already did the pretty, windy open world in Japan. That game had good art direction and a nice style to go along with it, something that [i]Shadows[/i] is lacking. After the first time you’ve seen the wind swirling through a field of colorful flowers, the visual doesn’t gain anything on repeated returns.

So, get ready for a lot of boring horse rides through repeated scenery. Ubisoft thought it was just [i]so pretty[/i] that it was worth replacing its already limited fun gameplay with a lot of walking around. Here is some open-world game design philosophy I’d like to impart: think of your open world as a world that is only as good as the method(s) to get around it and how interesting it is to explore. [i]Shadows[/i] does not have a fun way to get around, and if you’ve seen one ancient Japanese castle, you’ve seen them all, so exploration is a bust too. It’s completely botched the fundamentals of open-world design, and that’s not even touching on how the level-gating inherently restricts open-world games. 

The level-gating reflects more of the misguided decision to keep [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] a boring RPG where [i]everything[/i] is handled by numbers instead of being able to pull off an assassination. Naoe’s generic revenge story and Yasuke’s bizarre decision to help her simply because she has a blade on her arm have to get held up by the player making sure they’re at the Designated Area Level before they can take on the next zone in the needlessly large open world. An enemy shouldn't have six health bars that determine whether they can arbitrarily survive getting stabbed in the neck.

What gets me is that, even with its identity established for four games going back to [i]Origins[/i], it still feels like [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] has no idea what it wants to be. It finally put some focus back on stealth with Naoe, but there’s Yasuke bumbling his way through unfun combat sections. It has the “choices matter” branching dialogue RPG options, but it also has a “canon mode” where the story the writers actually wrote is what you get in the spoken dialogue. It even has a tacked-on, simplistic, and boring base-building mechanic that feels just as out of place as it did when [i]Fallout 4[/i] randomly threw it in ten years ago. This game has less confidence and ideas of what to do than the virgin nerd loser talking to the head cheerleader in a high school romcom movie. 

And [i]Shadows[/i] is inept on a technical level on top of it all. Any points it gained for letting me hit 60 FPS (with frame generation on) on maxed-out settings using a 4070 Ti Super and a 9800X3D are immediately lost when I have to reboot the game over a dozen times to get the DLSS upscaling and frame generation settings to even pop up. And that is not an exaggeration. I had to reboot the game [i]fifteen times[/i] at one point just to get both of those settings to pop up at the same time. I wouldn’t have cared as much if the FSR upscaling wasn’t noticeably worse or if the FSR frame generation worked at all. Ubisoft wanted to make a game that I wouldn’t want to turn off and the finger on the monkey’s paw couldn’t curl fast enough. With the game’s love for its DX12 error crash (the crash that made me decide playing this game wasn’t worth more of my time), I got to experience the joy of its 45-second launch over and over again! Yeah, I timed how long it took for me to hit “Play” on Steam before I could get to the menu to even see if the proper DLSS settings were available. 

[i]Shadows[/i] is a mess on nearly every level except for some of its stealth gameplay on its highest difficulty. It represents Ubisoft’s inability to learn and improve. It isn’t worth your time and money, and it certainly wasn’t worth mine. “Slop” gets thrown around a lot for games that don’t deserve it, but [i]Shadows[/i] is truly slop with no redeeming qualities to it that can’t be found in better, cheaper alternatives. As a miserable death rattle for a series that desperately needed to bring home a win, it should be avoided at all costs.",False,0,0,1743379539,76561198024411394,3161
191609946,english,"At the 87 hour mark and I have finally reached the credits... Coincidentally, 87 hours is how long it took me in Valhalla to pacify England. So the length of this game is as long as Valhalla.

[h1]Final Rating: 7/10[/h1]

The game is truly disappointing at every turn.  The game map and Feudal Japan are carrying the entire game.

Why the hell do cutscenes remove hoods and hats? WTH??? Even games like SWTOR from 2010 won't do that.

It's not the best Assassin's Creed game. [b]Valhalla is the best[/b] by miles. It's also not the worst Assassin's Creed game. I'd say top 5 AC games, if not top 3. 

[h2]The game needed to be delayed by 1 or 2 more years to refine with gameplay features and mechanics. It was not ready for the public as it's a very  bare bones Assassin's Creed game.[/h2]

--

The people saying Valhalla is too long, and the people saying this game was going to have a shorter story are sorely mistaken 🙃. Granted Shadows is a return to the RPG-level system, which means I have had to spend maybe 20 hours collecting XP just to go to the next part of the story or spend several hours learning how to play Yasuke.

[h2] The game has some of the best scenery I have ever seen in any video game.[/h2] If this game doesn't win ""Best Visuals"" of 2025  Award I'm going to be confused. 

Sound design is great, but the OST (Soundtrack) leaves a lot to be desired.

The map is pretty huge, despite not being as large as Valhalla. Even after 70 hours, I was still discovering new locations.

Double Assassinations have finally made a return thanks to the Tanto blade.

The game features constant progressing of seasons, so you get to experience Japan in Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, all with 2 parts each.",True,0,0,1743379480,76561198013506634,5638
191609665,english,"I'm far from done but...I think AC Shadows might be my favorite of the modern AC games.

Once you get it running decently, it's absolutely gorgeous. The advancements they've made to the engine really shine through in all the little details. The RTGI is almost mandatory (which may be a downside for some) but it grounds interior and exterior spaces really well. The destructible/physics based objects are super fun, especially in combat. AND they've finally fixed the ragdoll to not be so weightless. It's still kinda wonky, but I'll take it. Not to mention, the implementation of seasons is great for immersion and weather looks awesome in all climates. 

The combat is more thoughtful and precise than I remember from any of the other games, and even though some of the finishers can get repetitive, I'm still not tired of seeing them. The dodge, parry, posture combat loop is super satisfying and I like the stylistic changes with some of the abilities. 

Exploration has also seen some improvements. The ""unguided"" mode still tends to be annoying when you just wanna find that one person you gotta talk to, but on the other hand, they've solved overwhelming map marker problem allowing you to place markers as you go without getting burnt out due to your OCD. 

The story is okay so far -- simple setup, and to be honest, I've been exploring and doing side stuff for most of my playtime so I haven't really seen much of it. (I still haven't unlocked Yasuke) But I would suggest Immersive Mode or at least playing the Japanese dub. The whole thing feels way more natural. 

I can safely say, Ubi have made a good game here. For those upset about the monetization, I can understand that. But, in my 40 hours I've never even looked at the store tab and I definitely don't feel like I need to. Progression feels fair and not grindy in the least (so far).

If you're into the recent AC games, I think Shadows is a no-brainer. YES, it is just MORE of that. But it's done really well here, with some smart changes along the way. The setting is the star of the show as it is with most AC games, but the game underneath is pretty damn good too.

Fee-to-pay game. Paying 70 dollars only to be subjected to a scummy mobile game style cash shop.

I knew I was in for a quality experience when tutorial wanted me to run at a castle door to smash it open, at the same time as a bunch of allies walked up and stood in the doorway putting a mass of friendly hitboxes in the way, thoroughly preventing any possibility that the door smash animation could be triggered.

Stagnation. First impressions are that this is basically a reskin of the same game they've been artlessly making since Odyssey. Yet has been going down in quality with each incarnation.

I should add that, the camera is terrible.

Invisible walls are lazy. Lazier still is using the animus backstory to turn lazy invisible walls into a visible feature.

While it's expected that Yasuke, being a tank, would handle like one, I was very surprised to discover that the ninja (Naoe) isn't immune. Not quite as bad, she still handles like a fridge freezer on a heavy duty sack trolley.

They've had 18 years to evolve their combat, only their only momentum appears to take them backwards.

QuickTime events were huge at the time of the original assassin's creed. So for whatever reason, Ubisoft seems to have locked into combat by way of quick time events. Gameplay that feels like a mobile game.

Default controls are garbage.

Did I mention the graphics are pretty?

First impressions of the protagonists is that I like both of them. 

As I am learning Japanese, even an incredibly okay game would be useful to me, if only for immersion purposes via the Japanese dialog. Despite that, I find it hard to justify 70 bucks for what basically amounts to a mobile game wearing a AAA skin.

I love the idea of all the different factions you’re trying to take down and making a difference in people’s lives. And the hideout is so cool - you get to design it yourself! I haven’t done much to it yet because I’m waiting to unlock some more decorations (small, medium, and large rooms). But it’s so much fun to create something that’s totally yours.

The dodging has been a bit tricky for me, though. I’m either really bad at it or it’s just not working for me. Sometimes it’s delayed, and it doesn’t want to work even when I’m locked on to an enemy. And if I do manage to dodge, it jumps me back into them right away. It makes certain fights really hard, but it’s still doable if you use your abilities or just go for the assassinations!

I like the idea of doing different activities for points to make your abilities stronger overall versus levels as leveling in Shadows feels slightly quick and would make it where you become overpowered rather quickly.

191593832,english,"It is a good game if not the epic that Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla were. It doesn't necessarily close any gaps in the storyline, and it ignores some important parts of the game; it seems obvious that DLC is coming and maybe an expansion pack to finish what this starts. The choice between playstyles was fun -- it kept the game activities from feeling mechanical, although it's a little annoying to show up in one character and realize you need to be the other to complete it -- follow the storyline in order to know which you should be at key junctures, otherwise it gives you alternative ways to accomplish quests. It plays the same as the others with more emphasis on the local storyline than the guild of assassins or the Templars. There's no overhead eagle assisting you, and the special vision is mainly only for playing Naoe, the shinobi. It kept me engaged over the reported 58 hours of gameplay to the finish (on forgiving mode, which is not the easiest setting), and with gorgeous settings that are the games hallmark.

The Hideout: This has multiple facets. Decoration, Design,  The upgrading of the internal structure of your character is based within this internal environment.
Parkour: It's different in shadows. Past AC's permitted you to climb everything. Shadows makes you think. Not every viewpoint is easily acquired. Many are in the heart of enemy territory and the climbing to the vantage point isn't so straight forward. There are some viewpoint where the building is only climbable from certain points. Even enemy castles aren't just straight forward tank your way in. 
The seasons, the creatures, the history, the vastness of the world, etc.

+ Combat is easily the best of all the AC games. 
+ Graphics are top tier, really beautiful.
+ Controls feel fluid
+ Sound is incredible in surround/atmos
+ Zero instability and well optimized

But it's not perfect: 

- Holy hell.. 16 hours so far and probably 8 of those hours have been cutscenes.  WAY TOO MUCH. And if you skip through them, you miss important info, like ways you be responding to certain people. The fun in the game is combat, and it feels like the abundance of cutscenes doesn't respect your time. My gaming time is very limited as a father. I want to be fighting, not watching cutscene after cutscene the entire tme!

- Side quests are awful, this has not changed from previous games. Fetch this, do that, yawn, recycled and feels cookie-cutter and low effort. 

- Enemies still scale with your level. A common complaint in previous AC games, and it's still here, and still annoying. 

- Some weird bugs, like after assassinating a target, they get right back up like nothing happened. I'm sure this is an easy patch though. 

- After you assassinate a main quest target in a busy, enemy filled castle, you're basically just teleported elsewhere like nothing happened. lol. How did she escape the castle?

I judge a game purely on its own merits - I’m not going to sabotage my own enjoyment just because it has a microtransaction shop that I can simply ignore or just because it is Ubisoft.

And by that standard, this game is absolutely incredible. The world is breathtaking - easily THE most visually stunning experiences I’ve ever had. The lighting, the intricate textures, the lush foliage, the dynamic weather—every detail is incredible. In fact, I refuse to use my mount most of the time just so I can take it all in at my own pace.

I’ve never been too invested in in-game stories since dialogue often feels cringeworthy compared to a proper movie in my opinion. Also my play-trough rate in games is probably around 5%. But this one? I usually make that decision within the first five hours, and I’m already at 11 - so let’s see where this goes.

That said, if you take the time to understand the story, have an interest in Japanese history, or have even visited Japan yourself (as I have), you’ll likely find yourself immersed in its atmosphere. One of the best decisions I made was switching the voice language to Japanese. It completely transformed the experience - no more awkwardly translated conversations, just beautifully authentic storytelling that pulled me in even more.

191566494,english,"Just to give context for where I'm coming from in this review, I used to be a HUGE Assassin's Creed fan. I started with 2, played all the way up through Black Flag, and then took a break from the series. Gave Origins a shot and liked how it mixed things up. Even though I thought Odyssey was a good video game, I wasn't a fan of them leaving behind so much of the ""Assassin"" identity, and then I absolutely hated Valhalla. Thought the doubling down on the open world bloat and the aggressive push for microtransactions was egregious, and that it was clear that in order to do this, gameplay and overall creativity with the open world was pushed to the wayside. I've felt that the series has been getting stale for a while, and that the gameplay of the newer games just wasn't for me anymore.

Which is why I am genuinely, pleasantly shocked with how much fun I've been having with Shadows. Let's get into why.

[h3] PROS: [/h3]

First things first, the game is just absolutely gorgeous. Particle effects, excellent lighting and shadows, environments interacting to wind and rain and fire, it's just a treat to look at. The changing seasons is also a really nice touch, and I'm a fan of how certain seasons mechanically affect how you approach gameplay. 

Cutscenes and overall story are compelling enough to keep me interested, and definitely a step up from both Odyssey and Valhalla. The opening prologue of the game had me feeling like I was watching an episode of Shogun (probably helped by the fact that I'm playing with the Japanese/Portuguese languages turned on). While the story is simple and somewhat predictable at times, the characters here are so well written and have so much personality that I've been enjoying just talking to the different secondary characters you meet. Junjiro my beloved boy, I pray no harm befalls you at any point in this game. 

As for gameplay, the stealth feels like a Diet Phantom Pain, and I mean that in the most positive way I can - using the environment to obscure you, adapting how you handle certain enemies based on extra variables like extra armor or protection against headshots, making sure enemies don't sound the alarm, otherwise putting the whole region on alert to you (No Fulton device though, get on it #LazyDevs). On the hardest difficulty, enemy AI becomes incredibly dangerous to you trying to stealth around. It's a wonder how much harder a stealth game becomes when the guards actually look up! 

Combat is the most refined it's ever felt. While you're not going to have Soulslike levels of challenge, keeping an enemy's attack patterns in mind is very important, and the different abilities and combos you can achieve is enough to keep combat fresh and not have every encounter feeling too one-sided.

I'm also a huge fan of the dual protagonist setup. I'm always a fan of games that give you multiple ways to play the game, especially when the different characters have very clear strengths and weaknesses, and that's exactly what they've done with Naoe and Yasuke. While Naoe can get into combat, she is fully made of paper and will die in around 2-3 hits, so you need to be more careful when you do that. And vice versa for Yasuke, he's an absolute powerhouse in combat, but is about as stealthy as a bull (do yourself a favor and try to do a Leap of Faith with him, it's absolutely hilarious).

In terms of open world content, the side activities you can do all feel varied and engaging enough to keep from getting too tired of any one thing. My favorite activity currently being the meditation spots for Naoe. While gear is still the same RPG-style of loot, it has been streamlined and cut of a lot of the fat that was in Valhalla. The legendary gear you get from the big enemy castles feel like where your main focus should be, as that's where the tangible benefits are (Think the different armor sets in Ghost of Tsushima). While a little bloated, it's serviceable, and doesn't get too in the way of the rest of the game.

[h3] CONS: [/h3]

My biggest critique I have of the game is that, while the loot has indeed been refined, it still feels incredibly bloated. You will play for a couple hours and have 80 different white/green quality katanas that don't really do a whole lot different from one another. Like I said, Legendaries are going to be the main draw of the gear system, with all the whites, blues, and greens basically serving as dismantle fodder to make them stronger.

Building off of that, my second, smaller, more QOL critique is that the blacksmith should absolutely have a ""Mark As Junk"" bulk dismantle function, where it currently has none. When you're going through to dismantle those 80 katanas, you currently need to do so one by one, and it's tedious. I hope this gets added in a future update, and if it does I will edit this part out.

I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the microtransactions. While I do continue the same ideal that these shouldn't be in the game to begin with, the good news is they are not nearly as aggressively advertised as they were in Valhalla - they're hidden away and not at all a focal point at any point in my 20 hours of playing so far. And they all seem to be cosmetic, with no real game-centered incentive to spend any money on them at all, since they can also be farmed for in-game for free. My PSA for them is this: DO NOT spend money on them, you DO NOT NEED THEM, and even if you like the look of the armor, you can GET THEM FOR FREE IN-GAME.

And finally, my smallest critique is that I don't think the English VA performances are very good. To me, this isn't that big of a deal breaker, as I feel like most of Ubisoft's games are a 50/50 gamble on whether the voice acting is going to be Oscar-worthy performances, or complete phone-in stale line reads. But if you are interested in getting into the story and being immersed into the game a bit more, I strongly recommend picking ""Immersive Mode"" at the game start, so it switches all the voices to Japanese and Portuguese, which give MUCH better performances imo. 

[h3] CONCLUSION: [/h3]

As a fan of the old AC games, a fan of stealth games, and a fan of open world games, I think this game is incredibly fun and definitely worth your time if your fans of games such as Ghost of Tsushima, or MGSV: Phantom Pain. Go ahead and spam me with all the clown badges you want cuz you just have so much free time to be scrolling through reviews of a game you don't like - I genuinely could not care less. Ubisoft has done the unthinkable, and managed to pleasantly surprise me with releasing a genuinely fun game, and I give them props for that. I hope they're able to keep it up.",True,0,0,1743343659,76561198050028993,1272

191565517,english,"A Refreshing Return to Form for Assassin’s Creed
As a longtime Assassin’s Creed fan since the very first game, I fell out of love with the series when Origins shifted the formula. I even gave Valhalla a shot but never really got into it. But this game? This one feels different. It’s the freshest the series has felt in years.

While I still miss the Desmond-era storytelling, I get that it’s hard to recreate that magic. That said, what this game does deliver is something truly special.

The Setting: Absolutely Stunning
Running around as a ninja and samurai feels incredible. The world is dripping with atmosphere, and upgrading your base reminds me of Brotherhood, but this time with way more customization—something I really appreciate.

Yeah, there’s still some of that classic Ubisoft ""map checklist"" gameplay—gather, upgrade, repeat—but honestly? It’s done well enough that it still feels engaging.

The Weather & Combat: A Cinematic Dream
The weather system is simply breathtaking. Watching the wind sweep through the leaves, rain pouring down during a fight—it all feels so cinematic. It adds a layer of immersion that really makes the world feel alive.

And the combat? I wasn’t expecting to love it, but I really do. It’s smooth, satisfying, and way more fun than I anticipated.

The Only Flaw: Slightly Off Cutscenes
If I had to nitpick, the facial animations and voice acting in cutscenes feel a little awkward at times—not quite Mass Effect: Andromeda bad, but noticeable. It’s a small gripe in an otherwise fantastic experience.

To summarize
So far, this has been a really enjoyable return to the franchise. It captures that classic Assassin’s Creed feel while bringing something fresh to the table. If you’ve been waiting for a game to reignite your love for the series, this might just be it.

I am going to make this review for the guys who hate the ""if i was a dev"" blah blah blah.... ""okay game""... blah blah blah.... reviews. This is for those who want a short and sweet answer to: ""should i buy this game?"".

My answer. [b] Yes, buy it man. [/b] I have 34 hours, and have only just finished act 1. If you wish to know more... go ahead and read bellow.

For starters, to all those who are comparing this to Ghost of Tsushima.... stop. It is not a clone, they did't steal ideas and all that other nonsense i keep reading. [u] Keep in mind, Ghost of Tsushima was ragged on hard-af before its release, because people were calling it an A.C. rip off. [/u] And in my non-important opinion... It out A.C.'d every single A.C. that has been released. [i] Nothing, and i mean NOTHING; will ever compare to Ghost of Tsushima. That's like comparing a ""mouth hug"" (giggity) to a Flick on the tip. [/i] 

However, I'm going to be straight up and say it is a good game, on par with Odyssey and Valhalla. In the sense of game-play, exploration and world detail. It is a gorgeous game, the level detail is better than any title they have released yet. The enemy AI is different based off your difficulty setting. i am sure we have all seen the video of the guy crouching in front of an enemy and the AI is doing nothing; THAT IS ON THE EASIEST DIFFICULTY! Try doing that on expert and tell me the AI trash. I enjoy this AI more than any title they have put out yet. 

The skill trees are very in depth with many different play styles for both Naoe and Yasuke. The weapon types add a nice change of pace compared to other A.C. titles. You can pretty much make whatever build you want. With the knowledge ranks, i am unsure how i feel about them [i] (skill tree levels locked behind side activities) [/i]. I enjoy %100ing each area before i move on the next so its too bad. But, i also wish it took less knowledge points to unlock each rank. I like that the devs did this, because the world is gorgeous and you are meant to take your time when playing. Remember, its an [b] EXPLORATION [/b] based game; don't forget that. 

I feel like they have expanded on, and improved the stealth play in the game. Specifically with the dynamic shadows, sound awareness and prone implementation. Some people don't like that you can't wait for night to do a stealth run.... here is a thought... day time.... Play Yasuke... night time.... play Naoe.... weird. It's like the devs did it for a reason or something. I have been playing on the expert difficulty, it completely changes the stealth play and makes it very fun.... i am getting my poo kicked in constantly.. but it is fun. You get spotted way faster, if you assassinate a guy and he screams.... you're screwed, if the civilians see you they alert a guard who alerts more guards... kill the civis... trust... it forces you to play slow and plan out your path (very similar to Splinter Cell). Once you get the hang of the fighting mechanics i would [b] HIGHLY [/b] recommend switching over to expert. 

The story thus far has been like every other A.C.; The situation that caused the reason why you need to un-alive the people, classic betrayals and ""plot twists"". It's been extremely easy to call whats about to happen in the story. Again, i just completed Act 1. 

All that being said. I enjoy it, and i was fully prepared to play 10 hours and uninstall.",True,0,1,1743341743,76561198321805309,3926

191558655,english,"Its ""Fine"" I tried to enjoy this, but i have just been going through the motions with nothing else to do right now.

I have not been a fan of the RPG focused AC games, but did enjoy the originals up until black flag. 

I have now done a large majority of the content and I keep hoping for something different, the missions that change up the formula are too few and far between and there is only so many times I can go to a place, kill everything, loot reward that I will never use.

It lacks variety in its missions, points of interest, enemy types, weapons, perks, everything...

The fact it also wants more money from me for a lot of convenience just irks me, clearly seems like they added friction into the navigation so they can sell you the solution.

The base building sucks and is pointless, it may as well just be another skill tree, the fact its the only place you can get engravings changed is just frustrating when most other things you can also do at the little hideouts.

Tying your scouts to searching for every single quest location AND resources is annoying, i know there is an option to turn this off and i eventually did but why is it even there? if it was used sparingly, I could see it being a good mechanic, you gather scraps of info and then you have to locate a big boss, but no, its used for every little thing.

Navigation is just god awful, mount doesn't approach when called, spins in circles because it gets caught on things when changing elevation, no auto run feature means i constantly have to be watching where i am going, no relaxing downtime, fast travel....just let me fast travel anywhere I have unlocked or add way more points I can fast travel too, and dont have the points i fast travel into be hostile so cant then fast travel out if i make a mistake.

Decisions in dialogue trees rarely matter, why even have them. the story is just kinda, meh, I don't particularly like any of the playable characters or allies, they all seem pretty 1-dimensional.

I tried to give it a chance, if at the 2 hour mark i had known that I had experienced all of the variety the game had to offer, i would have refunded it then and there, but I was blinded by not having played an AC game in so long, don't make the same mistake as me.

The game is repetitive. It's basically exploring, getting quests, collecting resources, and murdering a whole castle! And it's actually fine by me ! First, the game superb, so exploring is a blast. Also, the quest system is smooth and not invasive. Then, infiltrating camps and castles to murder and collect resources is built around a well crafted and satisfying combat system. Probably the best combat system of the series (according to my expectations anyway).

Along the gameplay, the main story is well written (so far, 30 hours in). Side quests are fine as well even though it always ends up in searching for resources or murdering someone (but once again, the collecting and murdering gameplay is fantastic).

The game is beautiful. In its best in simplest way. Everything is meant to get you INTO the feudal japan, the weather, the vegetation, the lights...

Ubisoft, if you are going to force players to use your god awful UCONNECT launcher, then for the love of all things holy can you at least let the app REMEMBER my login so I don't have to manually log in every time I want to play this game?!

Also, you're soooo close. This is easily one of the best installments in the franchise, but it needs updates please!!! There are so many little bugs that drive me absolutely insane. Some of them include not being able to switch weapons or equipment in the menu for no reason and having to restart the game (yes I'm the correct level and I'm not in combat), eagle eye not functioning correctly and either blurring out objects way too much or not highlighting points of interest at all (like the temple collectibles you have to find to complete the location), or my least favorite, the assassination prompt straight up NOT WORKING. Sneaking up behind somebody and not being able to assassinate them at all (yes even super low level enemies), total bug.

This game needs one or two really big patch updates and then it will be perfect. I will list some positives about this game besides the obvious negatives which everyone else has pointed out. First of all, yes this game is beautiful. The world and graphics, particle effects, ray tracing, shadows, it's all gorgeous. It's also pretty well optimized, especially at launch. I have every graphics setting set to max, running at native 4K, and can still manage a smooth 60-70 fps on my low-high end setup. But honestly, I was expecting this game to look a little bit better. The graphic fidelity and crispness just isn't there. But I think RDR2 is the culprit and has ruined all other video games for me forever.

So yes, the game is absolutely stunning. Not quite RDR2 level but very close. The sound design is also really good, especially with some high quality headphones. The nature sounds are so relaxing when running around exploring. I'm not a huge fan of having to run around the entire map to get all the little parts of the map uncovered, especially when there are huge inaccessible mountains, but it's fine.

Where this game REALLY shines is the gameplay. The stealth is next level, and Ubisoft really knocked it out of the park when it comes to the stealth. Being able to go prone and crawl around, chain assassinate, sneak through ponds, and the addition of the grappling hook is genius. The combat is also fresh and responsive, doesn't feel completely different from the last 3 installments but just enough to keep it feeling fresh. The combat finishers are a huge bonus, as well as the cool black and white anime finisher screen.

I recently just played 40-50 hours of Ghost of Tsushima before I got insanely bored with the repetitive gameplay, and this game knocks it out of the park. The only thing GOT did better than this game in all honesty was the combat (GOT is much more fluid and smooth), and the voice acting. The voice acting in this game is terrible. I really wish they spent a little more money on hiring high quality voice actors, but it's fine. Other than that AC really has a lot more to offer. There is way more content, side activities (like the awesome base building), world exploration, graphics, sound design, even the story. GOT story was so bland. And the AC main characters are actually interesting and have some depth to them unlike Jin from GOT.

Anyway my rant is over, this game is really really good. Maybe not quite $70 good (I really don't think any game released in the last 2-3 years has been worth that amount of money, but it's close. Easy $60 worth of value. With a couple patch updates to smooth out some rough edges and gameplay, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be remembered as one of the best installments in the franchise. Easily the best AC since Origins. Nice job Ubisoft, please just fix the UCONNECT launcher and the very annoying game bugs. I've been a loyal fan since the release of Assassin's Creed II and have played every Assassin's Creed to date. Thank you!

191545617,english,"After keeping an eye on public opinions and getting opinions from friends, I've decided to give the game a go. Mind you, my recommendation may still change. That being said, at least for the first 7 hours or so that i've spend in the game, I'm thoroughly enjoying myself.

I've been able to look past the grievances that many people have brought up against the game. I've not seen a lot of Yosuke, although his fighting style in the start of the game seemed very brute and un-assassin like. After a few minutes however, we shift to the perspective of Naoe, and I've thoroughly enjoyed playing as her. 

The story by itself is nothing noteworthy, but i feel like ubisoft did a decent job so far telling her backstory. You get the important parts, how she ends up down the path she chooses in the game, but you can also unlock more background story that you play through. I think leaving it as an option is a solid middle ground. Those who want to play through it can, those who don't want to, can skip out. 

The huge open world is also more than worth mentioning. The world looks gorgeous, and with it's huge patches of forest, it just begs for exploration. It's just sad that there isn't a whole lot to find other than an occassional temple. I've been finding some deer along the way too, but I feel there's a lack of other wild animals i've seen on my adventure so far. Japan is well known to have bears, monkeys (who enjoy hot springs), not to mention creepy crawlers. I'm seriously wishing this would be represented in the game.

Like mentioned before, the story doesn't seem to be the strong point of this game. It's not deep in any way, and the story by itself is lackluster and I'd dare say lazy. There also isn't a lot of variety in side missions either. It mostly comes down to killing some soldiers or bandits, finding some hidden scrolls, unlock more backstory with meditation events, or an occassional exploration of a cave. Variety is lacking, but so far, I've strangely been enjoying going through this.

I also took a quick glance at the in-game store. I completely agree with everyone here stating that a microtransaction store is beyond ridiculous, especially since Ubisoft, in their infinite wisdom, decided to also put stats on these items, and offer grindable resources for money. This effectively making the store Pay to win. I deeply condemn the in-game store, it is not worth looking at. Though so far, I've also not seen any reason to purchase anything from it.

All in all, it definitely has plenty of issues. Is it a fantastic game? a masterpiece that everyone should play? NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. But have i been entertained, and do I feel like my purchase has been worth it? For now, the answer is yes. I'd say the game is about a 6, or maybe a 7 out of 10. Not a bad game, but definitely not great or genre defining either.",True,0,1,1743324824,76561198067176211,729

The new stealth mechanics are completely underutilised. I have never once had to hang from the roof inside a building or even lay down in the grass. Naoe 9/10 times wont drag people into bushes making you get caught instantly. Early game this is frustrating, but later on you get so strong, Yasuke lost his only purpose and Naoe could handle everything. By trying to appeal to both play styles they did neither well.

Terrible story and writing aside, the world is very one note, and I never want to see a castle ever again. They forgot to make side stuff fun and exploration was worthless in the end. Gear is just number go up.

Stealth on the highest difficulty feels more challenging than previous entries....enemies actually LOOK UP! Parkour can feel iffy, but I think it gets better as I get used to how to do it properly and not fight the controls. Audio is significantly better than the compressed canned-ass in Valhalla. Side quests and activities are enjoyable and diverse, especially on explorer mode. Naoe's and Yasuke's outfit choices slap hard with many looking unique and fit each character. Graphics are absolutely stunning and the weather mechanics are next level in both visuals and as a game mechanic. Whoever refined the hair mechanics needs a raise, watching Naoe's hair when it's windy is a technical wonder. Performance has been surprisingly great for an Ubi title at launch. As someone who has played every AC game to Shadows, this feels like a well balanced mix of old AC and RPG AC. Ubi did another fantastic job with attention to detail in the world, environments, architecture, and culture; it's inspired me to learn more on Japanese history.

Combat fun
stealth amazing
story is overall solid

good side content
good exploration (not just a checklist of markers)
good progression
good quest tracking
not buggy
overall performance ok
Parkour is fluid
great soundtrack
hideout system is fun
good weather system
cool destructible objects
good immersive mode
good accessability options
seasons are cool

THE BAD:
Facial animations & lip syncing really bad
Yasuke combat too easy and shallow (he can pretty much only do combat)
not enough verticallity in the map so less oppurtunity to express the good parkour
sometimes execution in the story (writing) can be off putting and sometimes cheap
periods where performance is poor
Boss fights are way too easy 

Overall this game is great and i would give it an 8.3/10
I am having a lot of fun with it and it doesnt feel like junk food unlike AC Valhalla (as i have been told) I've come to this game as a new player within assasins creed and in my opinion despite the verticality issues within the parkour the stealth side of the game makes this game worthy of the title ""assasins creed""
and on a side note (imo) there is enough diffirence between AC shadows and Ghost of Tsushima to justify a choice to buy shadows instead (or both) the weather system, hideout mechanics, and deeper stealth+general assasins creed familiarities and the diffirent more realistic art style allow the game to seperate itself from Ghost of Tsushima I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants a nice big open world game to sink their teeth into.

The game has a lot more cutscenes and Lore than I originally thought it would have, having played Valhalla and Origins myself, so that's saying something. 

My only issue, which is the same in every Assassins Creed game, is that the controls are clunky. Naoe keeps trying to climb everything when I'm just trying to have a nice walk. But that's not an issue unique to Shadows. That's just how Assassin's Creed games play and I somehow never get used to it.

191531178,english,"Longtime AC fan here, the only games I haven't played are rogue and the British one. I have particularly loved the RPG era games. Before Shadows, Odyssey was my favorite AC game.
SImply put, this one feels like the best of the RPG era. And if you've stayed away because the combat felt weak after the switch from the early days - it's time to come back. You can tell the devs worked really hard on this game, it shows. The game is absolutely visually stunning, the story and characters are great (yes even Yasuke, sorry haters), and the combat is sublime. Hideout system and gear customization are also really fun (big step up from Valhallla.) 
Anyone who liked the ""rpg"" era AC games will love this. Also anyone who likes open world action with rpg elements (Horizon etc.) will also likely really enjoy this game.

Try to ignore the negativity coming from miserable, dead inside haters, as well as any lukewarm receptions from jaded tubers or review outlets. This game is great! 
Enter with an open mind and you will be rewarded!

All that said, the game is very graphically demanding - don't expect max settings on an older system. That's not a reason to sh*t on the game - know the limitations of your hardware. The game is also very scalable, so you should be able to find a pleasant experience, just be prepared to play around with the settings to dial in your preferred FPS on an older system",True,0,1,1743308149,76561198014725482,4273
191530729,english,"(will do a proper review after i finish everything this game has to offer and then some) 

a HUGE step in the right direction for assassins creed, it just has that good ol assassin creed vibe

- the WORLD is big but not too big, and most importantly its NOT BLOATED and it's BEAUTIFUL  

- i love the HIDEOUT, you can def get creative with it, and exploring the open world finding roofs, watch towers, gardens, pets, trees, fences, different patches of grass / ground material (there's so much more to find) and just everything to customize it with is very satisfying

- the DYNAMIC SEASONS are very cool, something i never have really seen done in a game before. i love that winter actually makes the environment a bit more harder to move in, be stealthy in, can't jump into the lakes because they're frozen, etc.

- i also really enjoy adapting to Yaskue's and Naoe's playstyle in certain situations, i try to immerse myself into it.

- i think the SCOUT system is pretty cool, it's dope to smuggle resources. gathering resources in general seems to be pretty well done, it's satisfying to collect them, do contracts, etc etc.

- im reallyyyy contempt with the Transmog system, being able to wear the gear i want to wear while also having the choice to set the gears appearance to any armor/weapon i have collected during my adventures is AMAZING

overall really enjoying my time with the game, Ubisoft did their thing with this one forsure, story seems solid, side content seems solid, the open world seems solid, characters seem solid, boss fights solid, and the combat / stealth seems solid. THE AI IS ACTUALLY SMART, GOTTA ACTUALLY BE CAREFUL!!!

191528013,english,"After playing 19.4 hours.

I find it impressive!

I put my honest take as well.

here are the good and bad ones

Good
- The graphic is breathtaking! The effects of the winds, leaves, debris etc. It reminds me of my journey in Japan in 2018 and 2019.

- The map is huuuuuuge!

- The people surrounding like playing, conversations, farming etc. make the game into life

- most stuff are breakable, I was surprised I knocked the enemy guard onto the baskets of oranges and oranges fell everywhere. makes me kindof bad for the fruit stall owner.

- A lot of side missions

- skills of each character are amazing, if u love wukong, u love this as well

- This one of the unique feature of the game, where most open world games, they will tell u the exact spot of the map for missions. But this game will not tell you the exact spot but give you hints and using north south east west of the locations, of course you can use to scout to reveal the exact location, but if u run out, yeah it became an exploration which is pretty good, is like those land designer grabbing you and explore those areas. Nice job developers! nice way force us go around the map to find the real objectives. 

- Pretty awesome combat system, Naoe is the silent killer, agile, if u look into ninja type of fighting naoe is the one for you. Yasuke, the big tank, brutal guy, if you looking to play as hulk, yeah that's the guy, oh yes his kick send the man flying and u will ""this is Samurai!"" 

- If u familiar with games like Space Marines 2, I play Midnight fight exress too, which becoming a Parry King lol

- to be honest, some say storyline is cringe, but so far throughout 2 years getting games, this is something close to an amazing story, mainly ""spoiler alert"" for Naoe part. what amaze me that u can chose the fate of several people even side missions. to kill or sparing the person and affects the friends around you

- And yes, u can build houses and decorate them. So now this game is like, sim city and assassin creed got married and gave birth to shadow.

Ok now the bad ones

- The facial expression and animation abit off or not as realistic as before

- some enemies are easy or clumsy af

- yes story is good, the voice actors and actresss shld be more expressive, thankfully the storyline makes a mask on it.

- parkour is good but not like AC 1 or 2 style

- I think is a bug where I cant change my weapon even pressing R a lot time

- When map too big, that's where traveling can be boring lol

Conclusion
Apparently after playing, stalky Youtube newsfeed suddenly talk abt the game, as you know going to this era we have simply hate because of hatin on companies no matter how amaing it is. Sure, there are issues neeed fixing, I don't get the microtransaction, mostly are cosmetics, I will be angry if I need to pay extra to unlock main missions that kind, I bet they won't be angry other developers did the same. So I am fine with it, I bought the standard and got addicted to it, get new costumes and weapons by completing missions. people hating it, yes, Ubisoft as bad reputation of developing shitty games which is why I stopped at syndicate coz we lose momentum about it (fyi I didn't get Skull and bones coz that is one of their cannot make it game). This time I come to appreciate the efforts of those developers and designers to make a unique features, brainstorming, sleepless nights to make this game happens, oh yes, side note I was one of the playtest for Assassin creed syndicate, and I gave a feedback on one of side missions, and it took years, they listened and appeared on assassin creed shadows. And I am gratful.

So this game is 8/10, because I am love the sceneries and story",True,0,0,1743304639,76561198002988252,1966

Gameplay is solid, with a style very similar to other RPG Assassin’s Creed games. The stealth mechanics are impressive, and the setting is absolutely stunning. The graphics are gorgeous, and the world itself is immersive and well-designed.

One area where I wish the game excelled more is combat. I would have loved a more lethal difficulty option, similar to Ghost of Tsushima, where enemies feel less spongy, and every encounter carries a greater sense of danger.

Overall, I’d give it an 8/10. It does some things better than Ghost of Tsushima while falling short in other areas.

If you're unsure wait for a sale.

Performance: Runs fineish for the fidelity, however it seems to scale poorly with resolution so if you're having trouble with FPS you'll need to turn down graphics settings. Also the FPS ceiling is rather low so don't be surprised if you don't manage to get much over 60 FPS. Not a problem imo, this isn't some competitive shooter.

Visuals: Looks pretty great tbf. No complaints.

Controls: A bit janky, especially the perkour. Especially roof gables seem to suffer from sticky feet. Probably a bit on the worse side for the series but I haven't played any of the ""new"" AC games so I can't judge.

Story: Haven't done much of that yet, too busy doing side quests.

Gameplay: 

Combat is fine overall, enemies circle you like they usually do which looks a bit funny. Parrying attacks feels somehow off for me. Can't judge Yasuke's combat mechanics.

The Knowledge Trees are a nice feature, much appreciated.

Enemy Detection is a mixed bag. On one hand enemies do search for you for quite a while depending on how high their alert level was. So far I did not have instances where enemies full on saw me and then went ""must've been the wind"". *However* their peripheral detection seems comparatively poor. You can have a full on sword fight and the guards two rooms over won't notice or care. I understand why that is but it still feels a bit off.

Stealth feels nice, probably the best I've played in the Series (3, Black Flag, Unity). Gadget use feels very rewarding and makes the whole thing easier. So far I have also been able to play without having to use Eagle Vision, enemy presence is easy enough to pick up on via audio or visual cues, plus there, so far, have been no enemy placements that unavoidably get you detected which makes the entire stealth system feel that much more rewarding to use. I would, however, like some ability to switch time of day/lock it. Naoe receives several boni when it is night time, coupled with the stealth advantages and having the sun come up in the middle of a castle infiltration is a bit of a nuisance.

191512218,english,"With almost 100 hours couple days after release, i can confidently say that Ubisoft finally catched up to their bad luck.

The game is impressive, the world itself feels and looks genuinely so good to the point i would say it is even better looking than RDR2.

Having a proper setup ( playing at max settings on everyting with a 4090 ) made my experience to the absolute best possible and i was very enjoying every single moments of it to the point i was stopping using photo mode almost every 5 to 10 minutes.

The game looks stunning.

My only negative points to the game would be, too much re-use of character models, because theres instenses where character models from the open world, various quests or main quests were shared between each others and they all were completely different characters in the story itself. So it felt weird sometimes.

My last negative point would be not enough varities when it comes to combat techniques/finishers, especially for one of the main protagonist and probably the most played out of everyones playthrough.
The combat techniques of Yasuke felt refreshing more badass and gory when used because you don't play him as much as Naoe since the story and also the entire game itself ( 95% of it ) is more based towards her.

So when you switch to Naoe, the combat felt very repetitive because of the constant re-use of her boring combat abilities/techniques and i wish Ubisoft would've brought better looking and more techniques/finishers for her.

Other than these 2 complaints, the game is great and i would give it a solid 9/10

If you have a beast of a setup or have to money for it, i absolutely recommand you to play this game at max settings, because it is that good !

Definitely recommand this game.",True,0,0,1743288310,76561199447389848,6553

191510792,english,"Yasuke if you like Odyssey and Valhalla style beating the shit out of everyone, Naoe if you want to sneak around (but also beat the shit out of people with some upgrades).  Combat is surprisingly fun for both with varied moves this time around.  It feels simple at first, but I like that the skill tree allows for more and different combo paths rather than solely being ""gain 5% damage boost,"" though those are still present as well.

Both characters feel consequentially different in what they can and can't do, which I prefer over the meaningless character decisions in Odyssey and Valhalla, and to an extent Syndicate.  Yasuke can't parkour for shit, but is an absolute house in combat and has weapon swapping combos.  He can bust through doors like the kool-aid man and take on armies.  Naoe on the other hand has rope swings, fast parkour, and slick assassinations, including my beloved double assassination.  Crowds are a real issue for her, leaving you to spam the heavy kusarigama attack or get the hell out of dodge.  Each weapon on each character has fun unique moves, including unique assassinations for each of Naoe's weapons, and they all feel good to use.

Stealth is finally fun for me again, and I think one of the biggest impacts is not having the bow be so prevalent.  Yasuke can clean up a little with it, but in prior games you could just ping headshots and clear forts with no effort.  You had to choose not to cheese things with the bow.  Making sure Naoe has to get up close with limited range potential, when combined with improved movement from the grapplehook and the added ability to go prone in shorter grass or shallow water and the effect of light on enemy visibility, makes stealth interesting for the first time in a long time.  I also really appreciate that getting spotted and engaging in combat doesn't necessarily blow the whole castle for you, you can get back to sneaking around.  Perhaps unrealistic that they don't raise a huge alarm or forget that they saw me duck into a bush or off a ledge, but it's a game and I like that it isn't forcing me in or out of specific ways I want to interact with it.  It's fun without giving me clearly overpowered options to avoid.

I am not that far in the story, and I've got a feeling it won't get particularly more interesting, but this really isn't a franchise I play for the lore.  If you need a more engaging narrative, look elsewhere.  This is the pope punching ancient aliens franchise, where I get to meet a few historical figures and then go decimate the local population while still somehow being the good guy.  It plays fun and looks beautiful.  Every time a big story thing is happening, a corny 70's style samurai movie vocal track starts playing and I'm thrilled every time.  I'd prefer if it could be that and have killer writing, but the last time we got close was generously AC4, and at the end of the day I don't need it to be both.",True,0,0,1743287030,76561198409625305,1625

191500260,english,"I bought the $90 version of the game, which comes with some extra legendary gear and five mastery points. To be honest, the five mastery points don’t really mean much, and legendary gear is pretty easy to find throughout the game. So if you're planning to buy the $90 version, you're basically paying for the cool-looking skin—which I personally really liked.

Let me start by sharing some of my thoughts on the game. I’ve finished it and completed pretty much everything, except for a few “kill bandits” and “bring the treasured tea sets to Mr. Whatever” side missions. I’m level 60 + 5 (you can’t go above level 60, but you keep earning mastery points as you level up your “Mastery Level”—which is what that second number is).

I honestly really enjoyed the game. It’s very similar to AC Odyssey in the sense that it’s a large open-world RPG, and I was a big fan of Odyssey. I haven’t played AC or AC II since I was a kid, maybe 10 years ago, so I can’t really compare it to the older titles.

Story
I wasn’t a huge fan of the story—it was honestly pretty mid. But that’s how most AC stories have been in recent years, so I wasn’t expecting anything groundbreaking. I liked Act 1 quite a lot, but Acts 2 and 3 felt kind of meh. The ending didn’t hit emotionally for me at all.
Rating: 6/10

Gameplay
The controls are the same as they’ve been in recent AC games, so no complaints there—I’m used to them by now. I really enjoyed playing both Naoe and Yasuke. I tend to favor the stealthy assassin playstyle, so I had more fun sneaking around with Naoe and her tanto. But Yasuke was a lot of fun too—he's very OP and has a different kind of satisfaction in combat. My only gripe with him is that he feels super slow and doesn’t climb well.

The map can be frustrating at times. You'll see your destination is just 200 meters away, but you’ll end up running a full kilometer around a mountain because you can’t climb most of them—you just slide off, which can be torture. My advice: stick to roads. Shortcuts are not worth it.

I also loved the way different weapons had unique assassination animations. The tanto allows for double assassinations, the katana lets you kill through shoji doors, and the kusarigama has this awesome leap-from-afar assassination.

Naoe’s tools were super fun to use. On the other hand, I didn’t enjoy using the bow or teppo with Yasuke. They just didn’t suit my style and did way less damage compared to the long katana. The kanabo and naginata were fun, especially during the fights against your sensei’s students, but I mostly stuck with the long katana.

Scouts were a nice addition to the AC formula. I liked using them, but sometimes it was annoying when you had to use four just to find one objective.

Rating: 8/10
(Would’ve rated it higher, but the movement is wonky AF sometimes.)

Graphics & Performance
I’m running a pretty old PC—a GTX 1080 and 16GB of RAM, which is supposedly the bare minimum for this game. Even so, I played on high settings at 30 FPS and had zero issues. If I dropped it to low settings, I could hit 45 FPS, so honestly, performance wasn’t bad at all.

Loading screens were super short—like half a second, unless I was fast-traveling to a viewpoint. The only major FPS drop I experienced was when teleporting to my decked-out hideout; it would drop to 10 FPS for a few seconds, then climb back up to around 25. Not a big deal.

I don’t understand why people with RTX 4090s and 64GB RAM are having problems. Maybe it’s a driver issue on their end?

Anyway, technical stuff aside—the game looks beautiful. I loved the changing seasons, and overall, it’s a very visually impressive game.

Rating: 9/10

Final Thoughts
To the people complaining about microtransactions in a AAA game—you can just ignore them. You don’t need them, and AC games have had them for years now. It's nothing new.

191493521,english,"I will be the first to say i was not a fan of any recent Ubisoft title but they really knocked it out of the park with this one. I will preface this by disclosing i am running this game on a very high end pc with a 4090 but the game is gorgeous. The weather patterns, lighting effects and color leap off the screen and one of the best looking games i have played yet. Combat is fun,  fluid and very refined but condensed from other AC games which for me was a good move. Both Characters play very different from each other and i enjoy the parity and learned each's moveset. Story (so far) is engaging and i like the way they went about sprinkling in lore bits as you go instead of one massive story dump at the onset. Only bugs i have experience were one on the startup of the game once you first load in my game twice has crashed and actually rebooted my PC. I believe the issue stems from switching to my secondary monitor once i am already in game to use OBS. Otherwise i had a few weird audio drop outs with music during my first few hours but nothing major. Exploring Feudal Japan taking my time as i go from place to place is so immersive and i can say without a doubt this one is worth playing.

191493009,english,"This game... is not the best on every aspect, the only thing that stand out the most among other games is the graphic, maybe because it's the most recent AAA game(?).

if we talk about story, combat, open world activities, npc AI, we still can name a lot of games that is better on that aspect. But if we compare it to other assassin's creed games on this franchise, this is a SOLID game, i have spend a full week playing this game and having a really good time, it's fun and addictive for me who follow the franchise for like 12 years. 

I know where to put my expectation on this franchise, we have more than 12 main tittle and only some of them that is the goat, so i mean i know it's a controversial franchise for a couple years back, and i already expect it to have this kind of quality from this game.

If you have money and know where to put your expectation, want to have fun without really care about the flaws, buy it.
But if you want to be reasonable with your money, wait until it's on sale, but for me waiting a year for a sale it's kinda suck XD.

to compare, here's my top 8 from assassin creed franchise (not all of them because some of them i forgot since i play it a longggg time ago)
8. Unity
7. Syndicate 
6. Origin
5. Black flag
4. Shadows
3. AC 2
2. AC 1
1. AC 3
It's personal btw, so you don't have to agree on the list XD.

solid 8/10 for this game.

i.e. spend time to loot a castle just to get a Japanese building material? or, before revenge, the character has to learn Japanese music or Japanese tea ceremony? come on, who cares!

This is the most graphically beautiful world I've ever seen and the game does a great job of immersing you in it. Especially if you don't use the guided mode and turn up the difficulty. 

The more grounded approach to combat while still keeping some fantasy abilities does wonders for the gameplay and the story is compelling enough to keep me playing unlike the absolute sludge crawl that was Valhalla's main story. 

The dual protagonists works sometimes and other times it doesn't. The other character just popping up in cut-scenes even after hours of not seeing or interacting with them is jarring. I feel they just have just allowed whichever character wasn't being used to act as an ally so at least that way it wouldn't be so disjointed. But there is definitely fun to be had just Kool-Aid man running through castle doors and slaughtering everyone in your way with Yasuke after spending a few hours of sneaking around tactically with Naoe and their gameplay differences are definitely noticeable unlike in Syndicate.

The hideout builder is way more developed and flushed out than I thought and is a great addition.
The ability to customize the components of your weapons is a fun feature. 
The scout system is ok for gathering stockpiles, but i prefer to old method of viewpoints actually revealing the map/points of interest instead of playing whack a mole with scout bubbles trying to find objectives.
That being said having to actually visit locations instead of following dots on a map does make for a more immersive and exciting experience. I feel this system will really just come down to user preference and some will love it and others hate it.

191475878,english,"Not Good.

Assassin Creed Shadows looks amazing on the surface in terms of bells and whistles. After all, it's an Assassin Game that fans have been wanting for over a decade and counting, right? An Assassin Creed Game set in Federal Japan in an open world settling. I have honestly tried twice to really enjoy this entry and  kept telling myself, ""It'll get better, just keep going, it has to get better"" Mind you; this was the opposite the more that I played it overall. Where do I even start?

Setting: 

Assassin Creed Shadows takes place in Japan during  1579.  The map is massive and roughly the size of Origins but numerous problems arose the more I ""explored"" Japan. A lot of the open world environment is either forest or trees and both. This wouldn't be a problem if the game allowed you to bypass Japan's historical geographical environment and allowed you to explore it openly more. For example; your exploration will always be hindered and blocked by unclimbable rocks and hills that are waist high. You cannot climb something that theoretically SHOULD be climbable in terms of mechanic.  It's almost mind blowing at times. I would be off the path going to a marker and suddenly be hindered by a series of short mountain rock hills that was not climbable. You would think that these rock hills should be climbable to go over them at least right? I mean you can climb over anything in previous games. Why is this any different in terms of environmental surfaces? 

Ubisoft thought it was a good idea to block open world exploration. Ubisoft wants you to follow a set path by their design in this game. It discourages you to go off the path and explore the way you want to. It's so jarring and a lazy approach for an ""open world"" game that they keep totting. Every single marker on the map is blocked by a fog of war that doesn't get removed when you do sync points...Which doesn't make sense and according to their logic, the ""Observe"" function is there to give you a rough idea of where locations are within the game. So you're basically running around blind towards a question mark until it reveals what it is even after you do a sync point from a viewpoint.

Every location within this game is so repetitive and generic. It's either isolated settlements with no NPCS, caves, temples, a few sparsely filled towns, and castles. It's so rinse and repeat over and over again in each location on the map. The only difference is that you have to be at high enough level to even access each region. I had to contain rolling both eyes when approaching the same type of location in each region. Didn't I already see that castle before in the past location? Or that same environment burnt out settlement or generic looking Prayer Temple? 

Ubisoft really loves to copy and paste and it shows in this game. There's nothing unique about the environment other than the over hyped ""Seasons"" change feature. Each Season changes to the next after 28 minutes within in game time.  It wouldn't be a problem if it was so generic at times. The Environment during the seasons adds minimal gameplay effects when controlling both characters. They may move slower in snow, enemies won't see them when it rains, ect. But it's so repetitive after seeing it once before. 

Gear and Loot is as generic as in previous Assassin Creed games. You basically attach yourself to whatever is available in terms of body piece and headgear until something better comes along. You're weapons are complete garbage overall with uncommon and common, being the majority until you hit Legendary and Epic. Each Gear has perks and allows you to upgrade them with resources that you acquire from doing contracts and other open world looting. But it feels so rinse and repeat only worse compared to previous Assassin Creed Games.  Odyssey, Origins, and Valhalla do this a lot better and how you can equip individual pieces of armor to your Assassin which obviously led to crazy overpowered custom builds. Shadows reduces this by limiting it to only two items that can be equipped in terms of armor, the chest and headpiece which is baffling in terms of design. 

Assassin Creed Shadows has a problem with what consists of the same repetitive side activities. You either go to a location to collect pages, paint animals in the wild, prayer at Shrines, Mediate, and clear out a Castle full of enemies. The reasoning why you would want to do this is that you have to obtain Mastery Points in order to unlock the higher Skill Tree Levels, but it feels padded out in order to justify repeating the same activities over every single region in this game. It's so generic in terms of activity. There's no effort in these type of activities. A lot of people liked the previous side activities in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, and Shadows doesn't have the quantity or quality compared to those games.

Combat:

I really despise the combat mechanics in this game. It never really clicked with me and maybe because I was playing only as Naoe for the first twenty hours before finally fed up and bored. Combat consists of using two types of attacks: Light and Heavy in conjunction of using a hold attack to break stances.  You can block and dodge as well but the parry is either bugged or inconsistent even with correct timing input. Enemies either block too much or are extremely cheap of one hitting you due to Naoe's low health bar. They are also literal bullet sponges based on level as they level up with you. I felt that I'm hacking away too much with the Katana and doing minimal damage to an enemy that is the same level as me even when I upgraded my gear, or it's literally by design based on who I'm playing as. 

There is no reason why Naoe should be focused as a stealth character.  She will get into combat more often and you will have to fight a lot against enemies. Limiting two protagonists  based on specific play styles was incredibly stupid in terms of design point. It does not give ""diversity"" in how each character players. Making the other character with the inability to climb up sync points, hide, or even parkour is laughable stupid. I don't want to play as a brute in an Assassin Creed game. I want to play an Assassin within an Assassin Creed game. And don't give me that ""Well you're just being racist because he's black"" crap. I could care less what the ethnicity was for an Assassin was as long as the character was actually written well.

I won't even go into the story as it was so inconsistent and barely cared who I was killing. You basically can kill every single Order Member through random chance and it feels so hollow after doing so. Odyssey, Origins, and Valhalla actually gave backstory of who theses characters were when you killed them. In Shadows, it feels so generic and random. 

I never felt so empty while playing an Assassin Ceed game but Shadows filled that void. This game hides behind it's title. There are obvious large flaws within this game that Ubisoft has not learned to fix and continue to repeat. They do not learn from their mistakes. I regret buying this game completely and should have waited when it was on sale at 90 percent off. Do not buy Assassin Creed Shadows. It has issues all around and tries to hide it through smoke and mirror.

What I liked:
- Beautiful scenery, the change of seasons is a nice touch
- The story was ok even though you're left hungry for more (no spoilers, promise)
- Each playable character has in-depth, engaging backgrounds
- Each playable character offers unique skills, weapons and gear. If you feel like bursting through doors and cutting the foes in two, play Yasuke; if you feel like stalking in the shadows and one-shot them with the hidden blade or a kunai (throwing knife), play Naoe.

What I didn't like:
- Micro-transactions in a solo game at 70€
- They haven't thought out how to gradually discover the map. In plain language: if you're level 20 and look for a level 20 quest, you'll find one in a level 35 region at the other end of the map.
- Naoe: we know you're a shinobi. You don't need to do 3 backflips and a triple axel when jumping from a three-foot high roof. I found it ridiculous and it broke my immersion.",True,0,1,1743256902,76561198024687514,6184

- In all its quality, it is a far better version of Rise of the Ronin. The proposition is similar, with incomparably better graphics and more polish. Very reality-based historical settings, similar narration (sometimes very good, sometimes too rushed), similar focus on companions. Only the dating sim from Rise of the Ronin is missing.

- When compared to Ghost of Tsushima. The graphics is different. Ghost of tsushima is more stylised, Assassin's Creed Shadows is more realistic. Both are beautiful. The stealth system (in Expert mode) is way better in Assassin's Creed Shadows. For now, I would say that Ghost of Tsushima is better written.

 When it comes to open-field battle. Rise of the Ronin has a better overall system. But it is a niche genre game, where you have to train a lot to become good and acquire the correct speed of execution - a little like in Sekiro. Ghost of Tsushima and AC Shadows fighting are quite similar, with more weapons and more challenge in Assassins's Creed (in Expert mode, again). As I prefer challenge, I would be inclined to prefer Assassin's Creed.

191464101,english,"Well, let's start with the cons, and end with the cons of this game.
1. The game is an absolute wank transferred here straight from the Odyssey, constantly falling garbage armor and an absolute one-shot from an enemy 2 levels higher came from there.
2. Everything else here also came from the Odyssey, a huge empty map, a bunch of faceless buildings in the Japanese style. As in Valhalla and Odyssey, you simply do not have anything that looks good as the pyramids or the Nile (from the last good Assassin in the series). Some places are literally copied and placed, absolutely identical, with the same enemies located in exactly the same places. The developers are more interested in your wasted time than in your interests. 
3. Yasuke - this character has 2 main problems with the game:
The first is cultural, in this game a black guy who literally randomly swam to Japan cuts off Oda Nobunaga's head and then fucks his sister, what the fucking respect for culture can we talk about? Well, yes, he took off his shoes when he entered the house where he fucked her, respect.
The second is why the fuck do we need this character? In fact, in this part of Assassin's Creed you can choose whether to play as an assassin or play as a 2-meter tank that can do absolutely nothing that assassins do, but can rush into a crowd and kill dozens of enemies. And no, unlike the characters in GTA 5, for example, you don't play as them at the same time, they don't participate in the same events in 2 different places, no, you can choose to play as an assassin or jump around with Kanbo, an excellent choice for this series.

In terms of quality of work, this is the best part since Origins, but don't be fooled, the last 3 Assassins were complete crap, and the only reason you would buy this part, especially at full price, is to feel like a moron burying your favorite series in a coffin. And that's how I feel.",False,0,1,1743250081,76561198043355129,5906
191463657,english,"To be clear, I don't think AC Shadows is the worst game I've played. It's just ""fine"". The problems lie with things like bugs, disjointed and largely uninteresting characters and story, microtransactions, and things like parkor not really being suitable for the environments. 

I really think AC Shadows is a victim of timing. Other games have come out in recent years that do the whole assassin/samurai theme, do it better, and do it cheaper on the consumer side. Rise of the Ronin is more combat oriented and is an open world samurai tale that's more compelling of a narrative, even with a plug in user created protagonist. Ghost of Tsushima is visually stunning despite being a few years old now. It also has stealth mechanics, good combat, and a good story overall. Sekiro also exists, and is still an excellent game, while being more fantasy focused. 

Some of the things I like are the stealth mechanics. They're more involved when the AI doesn't bug out. The combat is usually pretty good, but the difficulty rating is kind of low, and fighting generally has you playing more reactively. There was a major plot point in the story I did appreciate but will omit details to prevent spoilers.

Things that don't work is the two protagonist. Their approaches are different with Naoe focusing on stealth and Yasuke focusing on frontal combat, but it makes it feel disjointed. Sometimes you enter a castle area with one character only to find its better suited for another. 

In the end, I think AC Shadows is a game of missed potential. The scope is too broad and comes off as a disjointed smattering of ideas. I didn't play Origins, Oddyssey, or Valhala, because I didn't like the progression system in those entries, While Shadows kept a lot of that it looked a return to form. AC in feudal Japan was a game setting I wanted since I played Altier's story back in 2006, but this one missed the mark. I do hope Ubisoft tries again, Aisa is a wellspring of historical conflicts that could make great settings for these games and Japan still has a lot of unexplored time periods that could make for interesting stories.

New combat and stealth is very nice.
Openworld is very much the same as the other AC RPG's just with a new Japan skin, but its certainly not as bloated and boring as Valhalla.
Im very happy this game is better than Valhalla, that game was a major dissapointment.
However if you look at it long enough you will notice you have definetly already played this game, if you played origins, oddysey or valhalla you have also played this game.

It would be too long to list all things i like about it, so i decided i would rather focus on the things i think need improvement and be fixed.
I do have to point out, that i especially like the stealth in this game.
One thing i can advice everyone to do, is to activate instant Assassination, cause it solves all Problems with the Gearing and levels in this game.
If u smart and stealthy enough, u can literally kill every enemy no matter what level.
It's literally the best part of the game and i actually dont see myself playing any other way so far, but i am still early so maybe that changes.

Now to my complains:
-One thing that bothers me a lot is a bug that happens once in a while, where the sounds of the game just completely glitches. U can basically hear nothing except few sounds anymore and only a restart fixes it. Really annoying and often ruins my experience when it happens.
-The Movement and Parkouring can sometimes feel a little buggy and unresponsive. Most of the time it works quite fine, but not just once i was discovered because the key for crouching just didn't seem to work.
-Combat in close spaces can be REALLY frustrating at times, because the camera sometimes just randomly starts to bug threw the wall and u can't see anything. It's very rare and only really is a problem when u mess up your stealth, but it still needs to be somehow fixes. Maybe walls becoming transparent during combat in close spaces, so at least u can see.

Overall i think the game is worth it, but i do have to say that 70€ is probably not the price u should pay for this game yet. Maybe wait for Sales of 40-50€ and then buy it, but overall i can recommend this game, despite it's minor flaws.

Pros
✔ Breathtaking World Design – As always, the environment is stunning, making exploration enjoyable without relying on fast travel.  
✔ Improved Storytelling – More cinematic and engaging main quest sequences add depth to the narrative.  
✔ Better Map Design – A more compact world compared to *Valhalla* and *Odyssey*, reducing map clutter and creating a more organic experience.  
✔ Challenging Stealth Gameplay – On expert mode, Naoe’s gameplay demands careful infiltration, with enemies detecting you faster and making assassinations more difficult.  

Cons 
✖ Inconsistent AI – While enemies are quick to detect you, they lose sight of you too easily after a short sprint.  
✖ Weak Assassin-Templar Conflict – The overarching lore feels underdeveloped in the first hours of the game.  
✖ Lack of Innovation– While refined, the game doesn’t introduce groundbreaking new mechanics. 
✖ Underwhelming Parkour – The movement system feels somewhat limited, mainly due to the structure of Japanese cities. This seems to be a tradeoff for making a large open world.

Verdict
Assassin’s Creed Shadowsdoesn’t reinvent the series since Origins, but it offers a refined and engaging experience. The criticism seems unfair—Ubisoft has made clear efforts in storytelling and gameplay. If you’re looking for a visually stunning world with improved stealth mechanics, this entry surpasses its predecessors.

191453854,english,"This game seems to have been made with the least amount of effort possible outside the marketing points. I strongly regret buying it, so much so that I've left my first ever review ...

The story is decent, with characters you can actually like for once. That's a shame, because the rest of the game is mostly repetitive, with little enjoyment to be had for me outside the main and companion missions. Some key points to explain:

- The combat has been overhauled and is somewhat complex on paper, but in reality you end up spamming light posture on every difficulty but the hardest. Even then, min-maxing and proper builds aren't necessary unless you go way outside your level.
- The ""legendary gear"" is  re-skinned normal gear, other than the special Oni stuff you can micro-transact your way to. Props for the in-game system to earn those though - micro-transactions are still dumb, but it's not the worst this time.
- The parkour system remains silly and is somehow both too simple and too hard: It will auto-chart every course, making some of the trickier passages harder because Naoe can't be maneuvered precisely, but at the same time makes most other sections entirely trivial
- It seems pretty uninspired overall. Example: The flashy Kata you can do with Yasuke uses his normal combat animations entirely, it just feels unrewarding. Like many side activities, it leaves you feeling like you're just ticking boxes.

The fact that the devs now answer on Steam to get you to engage on Ubisoft platforms for clicks is just the icing ;)

I'll probably finish the game at some point. Likely, setting the difficulty to story and just doing that is the best experience for me to avoid feeling like I'm doing chores for 40 hours. Bit of a shame really - it's really pretty and would have deserved more attention to detail on the open world side. Alternatively, just ditch it and admit you've made a good single-player game - but wait, can't sell gear for real money without an inventory system ...",False,0,2,1743239864,76561198006291011,1707

191453557,english,"In short, yeah game's pretty good. Ninjas fit extremely well with the Assassin's creed movement, and I remember people talking about wanting a japanese themed AC since 2 and 3. Get the game on sale, gameplay carries it something fierce, even if it's Ubi.

To be more elaborate:
The combat feels a lot more like Odyssey but without a demigod character. Having the enemies follow your level makes it feel like you are not really advancing, besides unlocking new areas, and that has been an issue in other new AC titles as well. Gameplay itself however is very enjoyable and fluid, even with the occasional struggle of  trying to make your character go through a window instead of running up the windowsill.

The game looks really nice, and despite my videocard heating up the continent, it also runs very stable. The addition of seasons gives a lot of visual variety throughout the game, which is quite nice.

The story... well, it exists. It is alright at best, honestly. Naoe's an alright character, basically what you expect from a ninja. Yasuke's also alright, his story is not going to change the world. Mind you, gameplay wise he is great, he's an absolute bulldozer, and franky, his parkour animations are hilarious and very fittingly not agile. 

Also, Animus is still in the story, for what reason they felt the need to shove it in, I cannot fathom, thankfully it is extremely minor. Probably to shove in microtransactions. Yes. As with any true Ubi game, they couldn't forego microtransactions, because a 70€ game absolutely needs you to pay for a fancy armour set to support this poor starving indie studio.

The bugs that forces my character to stop moving and die, not to so good; or getting stuck in a corner, also not so good; but it's ubisoft, the devs were given stringent deadlines so this is what you get in the beginning if they dont clean it up

Story & Character Wise - 

idgaf about the woke black samurai narrative these ""look at me"" social media babies talk about, Yasuke is cool af I love playing as him, he stoic too; just a great addition, but to the creed gameplay it doesn't really make sense Nao is cool though; if you chose immersive I.e. japanese audio the VA's are astounding as they usually are

Game-play -

Iffy in the beginning, and taking away an assassins assassinations because now apparently you can get pushed back by higher level or samurai dudes got my lifted an eye brow up - yes you can enable it in the setting to instant/always get the kill but to default and pretty much make it canon that this can happen is very.. non assassins creed like, and odd but okay still an option at least so that's fine.

The skill tree system is typical, nothing new there; weapons feel alright; feel sometimes cheated by camera angles and such and die to some BS but .. ubisoft. Overall gameplay is fine

Graphics - 

HOLY SHIT - my 3090ti is STRUGGLING here with everything up but MAN is it BEAUTIFUL; absolutely next gen in always, my GPU is fighting for its life so I turned it down SLIGHTLY so I could get at least 60fps and it is still gorgeous. 

Overall for me - 8/10; I found some glitches and BS had me Alt+F4 but still I found reason to reopen and keep playing so I recommend WHEN IT'S ON SALE IF YOUR BROKE, if you're not then buy it, it's fun.

191441654,english,"Overall 5.5/10 Game for me

The world itself is absolutely gorgeous, full of life and vibrance that you don't really see in AC games. The sustenance in that world is awful. Literally only 5 things to do while exploring; finding ""hidden scrolls"" (if those are consider hidden, then the monks working there must literally be blind), honoring shrines that are stupid annoying to figure out which ones are the right ones, taking out samurai at the castles, exploring tombs, and doing qte until you rage because for some reason you cant press two keys at the same time. I had to listen to podcasts to get through exploring the same things over and over and over again to get through it.

I thought the story itself wasn't awful, but wasn't great. Same used trope over and over again. Do I succumb to vengeance or learn how to serve the people and get over the anger. Overused and old at this point. Yasuke story and how he tied back to the templars was a cool twist I wasn't expecting. Could call Yaue's story from the beginning. The romancing in this game was completely dumb. Did not add anything into the game whatsoever, and there was no benefit to doing so, so why add it in in the first place?

Combat was subpar, only two finishing moves for each character that got old realllllllly quickly. Towards the end, I was just hoping the finishing moves just wouldn't pop up (obviously they did not). Having the different weapon types was dope, just that you aren't stuck with just a sword could spice things up a little bit when it came to combat.

Also, what happen to the Animus and real world story?? Did we just say f it and cut it all out? Who was actually in the animus while this was going on?

If Ghost of Tsushima hadn't came out 5 YEARS AGO, and Rise of Ronin hadn't come out a few years ago, this game would stand alone as the best Japanese based game IMO. GoT just takes the cake in literally every aspect, unfortunate that this game is just a clone of it.

191441449,english,"It's a good Assassin's Creed game. The world is beautiful and you could walk around and enjoy the view everywhere. The detail of this world is incredible as every AC game.

Don't expect complicated game mechanic or any consistent movement from parkour system here. They improve the speed of the character but they didn't make the parkour consistent (it wasn't consistent even in Unity, and I think Unity is a good game, but I still expect movement in stealth games to be consistent and precise, yeah, nowhere to be found here).

The world is beautiful. Stealth is better than ever (I'd say stealth is more consistent than in Unity despite how bad the movement is). Combat is more challenging. I'd say Ubisoft is doing a good job.

The only criticism here I have is how many quests are copy-paste of one another. Killing 25, 50, 100 bandits in each regions are not really interesting. I'd rather have less quest.

2. The parkour/movement system is pretty fluid, except certain instances where the player gets stuck in the corner of roof + wall. Not knowing which surfaces can be climbed is also frustrating at times.
3. I enjoyed the relationship and witty banter between Naoe and Yasuke as friends.
4. Story writers nailed the emotional connection of players and the two protagonists as well.
5. My favourite aspect of the game is the world design and graphics. It is definitely the best of any Assassin’s Creed game, and I hope that Ubisoft will continue to build and improve upon future games.
6. Level design wise, most castles and target outposts feel quite similar.
7. Stealth is entirely optional as there are no permanent or strong consequences if stealth fails.
8. Unfortunately, replayability is very low, and there is not much to do after completing the game and making your perfect hideout.

191438688,english,"Haven't played any AC in a couple of years but I really, really like this one.
It's a absolutely beautifully crafted world with stunning visuals and amazing sound effects that make just running through the bushes or watching it unfold from a tree breathtaking. The weather and seasonal effects add to that. The world is fun to explore, there's a lot of attention to detail in the shrines, buildings, fields and cities.
The stealth play is okay/good - it could certainly be better, but things like different tools for Naoe as well as luring enemies and sometimes engaging ""puzzles"" to solve a place are fun; I wish they would lean a bit more into that, I feel like it has a lot of potential but falls a bit short.
The combat is fun - it's way better than the endless parry / riposte system I remember and while no Dark Souls or anything like that, it is engaging as well. 
The different weapons play very differently, the skill trees add fun improvements and twists.
The system to change the appearance of your weapons and clothes to your liking unlocks early and is really well made - for weapons you can even change 2-4 different parts.
While the story is probably more or less the same for every AC regarding the overall structure, I really like the intrinsics on this one. They added a lot of details to the world, the motivation of the characters, the backstories which make it interesting and ""relatable"".

They changed up leveling up system a bit and skill trees have to earn mastery points to unlock next tier. 

They added Animus system where you can earn points just playing the game to unlock rewards like almost season pass like system. Doesnt cost any extra money just doing objectives for points to unlock the passes or reward tracks. I did have issue with this at the time of writing this where it wouldnt connect unless I unlinked some things I had to Ubisoft like twitch, facebook, steam, and etc after it worked redoing the links seemed to get it to work. 

Lots to do it can be bit overwhelming for some folks if you dont take things zone by zone and focus on certain aspects of the game and exploring. 

If you lore/history junky lots of that in the game too. Certain points you can inspect and get information about shires, forts, locations or objects you are obtaining. Im sure they'll eventually add discovery tour. It will be great additon when they do. 

In short I do recommend it if you like this time of assassin creed games. Great story, amazing locations, and different approach to combat that takes bit to get used to.

191433683,english,"Actual honest review by someone who is not politically blinded and used to love AC before Origins and all the RPG crap.


TLDR; not recommended right now, wait for sale if you're interested, it's an above average game, not great, not terrible, better than Odyssey and Valhalla, gameplay is ok, English dub is atrocious, story is alright, micro transactions are ridiculous, and it has a few but very annoying bugs

something about other reviews first: game definitively doesn't deserve ""Very positive"" status it should be ""mixed"" or ""mostly positive"" at best, it feels very odd that you go into the review section and all reviews are positive and say something along the lines of ""10/10"" or ""masterpiece"" coming from profiles with less than an hour of gameplay and have comments disabled, but if you click into the browse all reviews section you see nothing but negative reviews it really feels like there could be foul play on ubisoft's part or someone else actively overprotecting the game

first of all the game is definitively not a masterpiece nor the worst game ever made,
but for he love of god enable immersive mode and guaranteed assassinations the English dub turbo-sucks, the Japanese one 1000x better, and level checks to assassinate don't feel right

setting-wise it portrays a semi accurate 1600's japan, it tries to be realistic but it's combined with a cliched western view of what japan is, there are some ""modern"" topics in the game, that feel weird in the setting the game tries to portray, it's not so much of a problem that it's there, as much as how it's implemented, it feels really lazy and inorganic like it is only there to check a list,

story-wise: it's alright, the narrative is definitively not as strong as the old games, but in the end it works, there are some parts that feel like padding in the story though

Yasuke's whole story and character development feels like an afterthought he could have been easily an ally npc like leonardo in the ezio trilogy or adewale in black flag and it would feel the same, it feels like they added him late into production to appeal to players that don't like stealth,

now naoe on the other hand has the strongest story and character arc out of the 2 and feels more like the main character, her gameplay in my opinion is the most fun out of the 2 being more dynamic and challenging than yasuke's, her gameplay feels like an actual assassin's creed game,

if you dislike either one of the two characters you can just ignore one and play as the other through the whole game, there are few parts of the game that require to play as either one, and when you're given the option to choose it doesn't really matter which one you pick

the RPG systems are mostly ok, sometimes annoying as they break immersion but not as much as they did in Valhalla or Odyssey,
the game adds a new system of scouting that replaces the 100+ markers on the map typical of ubisoft games, it's interesting and a bit more engaging but in the end they are just the same task of cleaning the map,

the micro-transactions are outrageous and i would recommend no one to spend any money on the in-game store, the cosmetics you can get look like mmo color-puke garbage, and the ""time savers"" are just dumb ways of cheating your way through progress

there are a few bugs but these bugs are of the annoying kind (crashing your game and not letting you progress through a part of the story, turbo screen flickering if you are using g-sync, etc..) and feels like ubisoft adds more with each update

191428727,english,"Honestly, aatguably the best AC game depending who you talk to. 1-3/brotherhood is amazing, but for open world style Assassin's Creed's, I absolutely think this ranks top 3 with Valhalla and Odyssey. My personal favorites!",True,0,2,1743211110,76561198165866736,3609

However if you were hoping for a smooth experience on your Steamdeck or Rog Ally X you will be very disappointed like me. Even at low settings it runs like crap and looks a bit better than a Switch. Ubisoft should fix this bc I can run all the other Assassins Creed games just fine on my Rog and they look great, but this one is awful. Btw I love the story so far, i'm not closed minded.

****UPDATE***** 
After some tinkering I found the best settings for my Rog Ally X, I don't own a steam deck but i'm sure there is a way to get it running properly. I had to mess with settings i've never had to mess  with before.

BUT i was KINDA hesitant when they finally announced it, but the story so far, 30 hours in and just got to play the samurai guy, I love side missions so. Its been great with a few hiccups, one glaring issue atm is the lag and stuttering when going back into the game from exiting from the inventory, or map, Its as if the game is reloading assets and reacquiring the graphics and stuff, its really odd and frustrating, also screen tearing with VSync on, and thats with DLSS on or off or even TAA or nothing, doesn't matter what the settings are, even forcing settings from NVidia's options, not the APP, the NVidia App wont even acquire the settings, but it wont acquire settings for a lot of other games, not sure what was changed. But anyways, other than that the game looks beautiful, (Maybe the brush and trees are a bit too thick in places) The game looks and feels alive, the AI and NPC's react really well, the voice overs for the imursive japanese language is too good, I enjoy reading the subtitles since i grew up watching subtitle movies from the 60's and stuff. Getting resources isn't a grind, its actually enjoyable, upgrading armor and weapons is really nice, the skill tree's CAN seem daunting but its really well put together, its nice to make a focused skill or do an all around style. The fact that you can crawl/go-prone is really nice, it opens up a lot of new ways to sneak around. One anoying thing is that the walls around castles are impossible to climb, there might be a skill to help with that but I've been finding myself to find that ONE single entry, or just literally running through the front gates then hiding from the enemies that spotted and run after me. So far, 7/10 and thats because of the optimization issues, I'm sure they'll fix that in due time so i'm not worried, there are ways to fix it, ITS NOT GAME BREAKING ...",True,0,0,1743211036,76561198017256554,3922

191427534,english,"Let's get the cat out of the bag first : Would this have been a better game without Yasuke ? Yes, 100%. Replace him with any japanese Samourai and it would have been so much better.

However, that aside... It is legitimately a really good game. Gameplay is solid, Japan is beautiful, the voice acting and the general acting is frankly S tier (at least in immersive with Japanese/Portuguese, which I'd highly recommend). Characters are well written and that includes Yasuke. I still dislike he was chosen, but I cannot deny that he is well written and enjoyable to play with. 

Beyond that, it's your standard AC game by now, though Assassination takes a whole new level with Naoe's tools. Even Yasuke's more combat oriented playstyle is frankly good, it plays well and from time to time, it's fun to just go in and fight everyone. We've all done it in previous games because it's just a fun combat system, so why not have a character designed around it and let players choose how they want to approach each situation ?

Additionnaly, you can play a vast majority of the game as either character, though Naoe is the main character here and not Yasuke, which is another good point. He's a side character and a good one at that. The story is classic, albeit again well written. Even though it is predictable, the writing and the character acting makes it a pleasure to play.

191427061,english,"[h1] Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review – A Step Forward, but Not a Leap [/h1]

Assassin’s Creed Shadows finally delivers the long-requested setting of Feudal Japan, bringing an ambitious open world with dual protagonists, Yasuke and Naoe. At its best, the game presents an engaging story, particularly in its opening and closing moments, where emotional weight and strong performances shine through. While some have criticized the voice acting, I found the performances of Yasuke and Naoe in emotionally charged scenes to be quite effective, adding depth to their characters and making their journeys feel worthwhile.

Yet, for all its strengths, Shadows struggles under the weight of familiar Assassin’s Creed pitfalls. The open-world activities, while expansive, often feel repetitive and lacking in meaningful variety. Ubisoft has once again filled the world with objectives that can feel more like checklists than engaging experiences. While the world itself is visually stunning, from dense forests to feudal castles, it sometimes feels more like a backdrop than a living, breathing place full of organic storytelling.

The game does take notable steps forward, particularly in its approach to stealth. The Splinter Cell-inspired visibility meter is a welcome addition, finally making light and shadow integral to gameplay. Combat, too, feels more refined, with a greater emphasis on timing, parries, and skillful engagements, rather than the hack-and-slash approach of previous entries. It’s clear that Ubisoft has tried to bring back the tension and challenge of earlier Assassin’s Creed titles while maintaining the accessibility of the modern RPG formula.

Character development is hit or miss. While Naoe’s story arc is well-crafted, Yasuke’s feels underdeveloped for much of the game. His personal motivations take too long to become compelling, and it’s not until the later portions that he truly comes into his own. This uneven pacing makes parts of the narrative feel stretched too thin, which can lessen the emotional impact of key moments.

Technically, Shadows isn’t without its flaws. While it runs well for the most part, there are occasional performance dips, stuttering, and AI inconsistencies that can break immersion. Enemies sometimes react strangely or fail to notice obvious stealth kills, which can make certain sections feel unpolished. It’s not game-breaking, but for a series that has been around for so long, these issues are disappointing.

Despite all this, I found myself seeing this one through to the end, something I haven’t done in an Assassin’s Creed game since the original. I never finished Valhalla, Origins, Odyssey, or Mirage, but this one at least kept me engaged enough to reach the credits. While it isn’t a masterpiece, it’s at least a step in the right direction for the franchise. If I had to pass the time, I could see myself continuing to play, taking on missions and exploring what’s left to discover. Assassin’s Creed Shadows isn’t a revolution, but it is a game that—despite its flaws—offers enough to keep fans invested. A 6.5 out of 10 feels right.",True,0,0,1743209418,76561199180123945,1629

In those games it was a joy to go through a 'castle' , here, it's either a chore if you approach it with stealth or a mediocre hack and slash when you go ' swords blazing'. lose lose imo.

Valhalla was clunky and this is clunky as well. It's a design choice mostly, but not my taste.
I always get the feeling that the people orating for 'more grounded and weighty combat and movement' is just a very vocal minory, but they somehow got their way....

Waaaay too many cutscenes in the beginning. Yes, story can be nice, but if I'm sitting down for just an hour I want that hour to consist of at least 45 minutes of gameplay. World feels empty and ultimately it's just another ubisoft map marker fiesta.

Last AC game for me. I enjoyed the heck out of Origins and Ody, I gave Valhalla a good spin but got burnt out due to its sheer length, but this one left me dissappointed.

On the one hand, the stealth is good, and they got Feudal Japan right. It's surprisingly respectful of the culture and history, though Assassin's Creed historical silliness is certainly present. Naoe is great.

But, on the other hand, the game is painfully bloated. World of Warcraft quest design [negative] pervades the midgame. While the combat is good, enemy variety is lacking at a point. The microtransactions are aggressive

There's a really good game at the core here, buried by a lot of Ubislop. It's a ""podcast game"" when you're not on a core story mission. Maybe I'm just tired of open world games after a few decades of em.

The story so far is well-written, albeit in a very simple way (revenge plot/a McGuffin to drive Naoe's narrative/Diogo entering the service of The Big Bad but narrating the beginning as if he's foreshadowing the AC Shadows story from a future state, i.e. his story may seem one way but will go another). 

To me, the loot rewards are almost secondary to the entire gameplay loop. I'm gathering a ton of resources and using them to simply upgrade my Legendary Tanto to my current level, instead of just hunting for new weapons in the open world. 

The fact that you can pick/choose your battles when hunting Samurai in the castles is also part of the fun. 'Ninja's' as we know them in the West are rarely seen, but extremely lethal. I'm glad AC Shadows allows the player to indulge in that gameplay style -- although you could definitely use Naoe's skills and wipeout an entire encampment if you choose. 

Usual Ubisoft bugs/jank here-and-there, but nothing gamebreaking (yet). I almost lost my save 8 hours into the game thanks to the weird Ubisoft Connect cloud situation, and sometimes the game loads environmental elements right in front of your face as you're running up to them (I'm running with a good rig, and can run beefy games at Ultra, so not likely a 'me' issue).

191417098,english," A Disastrous Misstep – Avoid This Game at All Costs 🚨

It’s rare to see a game fail on almost every front, but this title manages to do just that. ❌ Lack of cultural authenticity, 🔄 recycled gameplay, 🤑 misleading marketing, and 💰 an exploitative monetization model make this one of the worst releases of 2025.

1️⃣ A Hollow Representation of Japanese Culture 🇯🇵

One of the biggest selling points of this game was its supposed deep dive into Japanese history and culture. However, it completely misses the mark. From historical inaccuracies to questionable character portrayals, it’s clear the developers had little interest in genuine representation. If you’re expecting an authentic samurai experience, prepare for disappointment.

Even the music selection in the trailer mistakenly features a 🎶 Chinese instrument instead of a Japanese one—a glaring error that speaks volumes about the lack of research. How can a game claim to honor Japanese history when it doesn’t even get basic cultural elements right? 🤦‍♂️

2️⃣ Copy-Paste Gameplay from Previous Titles 🔄

If you’ve played ANY previous games in this franchise, you’ve already played this one. The mechanics are uninspired, the side quests are repetitive, and the core gameplay loop is an exact replica of past entries. There’s no innovation, no meaningful changes—just the same tired formula, repackaged and resold. 💀

🗡️ Side quests? Almost entirely “go here, kill this” missions with zero creativity or depth. It feels like the developers ran out of ideas and simply recycled old content to fill time. Lazy and uninspired. 👎

A Pathetic Attempt at Deception 🤡

Rather than relying on actual quality, the game’s publishers resorted to buying fake reviews to manipulate the public. 🤑 Paid bot reviews flooded YouTube, trying to mask how truly awful this game is. If they had ANY confidence in their product, they wouldn’t need fake praise. 🚨

And the worst part? A BATTLE PASS… IN A SINGLE-PLAYER GAME?! 🎮💰
There’s absolutely NO reason for this game to include a battle pass other than to squeeze more money from players. It’s an absolute cash grab and proof that the developers care more about profit than making a good game.

This game is a shameless, uninspired, and greedy attempt at a historical title. Fake marketing, cultural inaccuracy, copy-paste gameplay, and pay-to-win mechanics in a single-player game make this one of the worst releases of the year.

191412148,english,"It's pretty solid. Had a lot of fun with the gameplay mechanics and stealthing around castles which is easily the best part of the new game. The ability to go prone adds fun new dimension to stealth and the combat felt the best out of the RPG saga so far. It definitely plays the best out of the last few Assassin's Creed games. The graphics are stunning and the dynamic weather and seasons, while not having much impact, definitely add to the immersion.

Unfortunately, the side content is absolutely dismal. Praying at temples and finding small pieces of paper to unlock the next tier of abilities is mind-numbing. The story also has the most abrupt ending I've seen in a title for some time, with very little build-up to justify the roll to credits. Side characters are also incredibly forgettable, despite some of them joining you at your hideout. 

Overall, I've had a good amount of fun with the time put into this thanks to the gameplay alone, but it does fall into the same usual traps that come with a modern Ubisoft open-world.While the main characters are great, the rest of the cast make the story a bit of a chore to play through. 7/10.",True,0,0,1743195059,76561198087781095,2936

The movement system feels clunky and unintuitive, often leading to frustrating moments. On multiple occasions, I died because my character unintentionally climbed onto a railing, where I was unable to dodge or deflect attacks, and getting down was neither quick nor easy.

The process of acquiring knowledge points—whether through temples or meditation—felt repetitive over time. The combat system, while relatively simple, remains intuitive for the most part.

Exploring the world is enjoyable—as long as you stay on the main roads and trails. The moment you stray from them, however, navigation becomes a frustrating slog. The terrain often feels like an unpolished slush, making movement cumbersome and needlessly difficult. This detracts from the immersion and discourages true open-world exploration.

Good stealth - massive improvement over Mirage, and the previous Trilogy since moving to Anvil 2.0

Slow burn story - I am yet to be compelled by anything other than Avenge my dad and Non-Asian Samurai.

191404802,english,"It's simply not good, forget all the controversy surrounding it for a minute(not that those things aren't inherently a problem in the game) and listen to a long time player

Pros:
- for all it's worth the game has nice visuals...when they work and are freaking out.
- the JAPANESE voice acting is pretty good

that's about it for what i think it did well in, 
Cons:
- It goes back to the leveled gear systems from Odyssey and Origins. This system for Assassins Creed is just bad, you can't defend it, as it's simply not made for these types of games. Ubisoft if you make it through this, please stop adding this system and make gear normal and upgradable. You don't even need to change the visuals just stop making weapons that are legendary become obsolete two character levels later by mid-tier gear.
- Exploration is somehow designed badly. I thought what origins established was a pretty good way of  exploration you can go just about anywhere and can climb just about anything, Shadows takes out both of these and puts lots of barriers that you cannot cross in your way forcing you to complete quest, or open world activities the way the developers want it done. 1 pathway to victory is not something that assassins creed has had for a long time and it's time to get rid of it again for better systems.
- Voice acting(in English) is laughably awful. it's worse than Dynasty Warriors 9 voice acting. almost like the Voice Actors themselves were given 10 minutes to read the entire script and then just go at it. games that are made to be over the top get away with this due to the over the top nature of them. AC: Shadows wants you to take it seriously but has no emotion in the dialogue, so it comes off as bland, cartoonish, or just non-engaging as a whole.
- Two-Characters is a bad concept for Assassins Creed. If you want to play a non-stealth game as a big bruiser type character, then maybe play something designed for that, don't take the assassin out of assassins creed. it's supposed to be stealth based, which is why Naoe is almost great to play as, except her only ranged weapons are kunai, some smoke bombs and probably some other small weapon. but no bows or guns. I can discount having a firearm, but she's a ninja, she should have a bow. Instead that's given to Yasuke who is piss poor at stealth(not that he can't). Instead it would have been better to axe yasuke in favor of Naoe and make her story more developed as...
- The Story isn't that great. Now granted the story of these games were always not something to write home about, however this one is similar to Odyssey where i really don't care what happens. even worse the game basically overwrites your decisions in the story to take the ""canon"" responses. I am not playing on Canon mode, and you can pick the wrong answer to a question and Naoe or whoever she's talking to will push the other option for you anyways. Your choices are almost as worthless as in odyssey where none of your choices actually mattered.
- Combat is somehow a step down from valhalla, which has a decent enough system. Assassinations are no longer instakills, unless they are weak enough or you have the skills that allow you kill highe health bar enemies. I don't understand how Ubisoft can just take assassinations out of their assassination simulator time and time again. it's bad, and whats worse there isn't even an option to turn on instakill assassinations. Valhalla at least pointed out the game wasn't designed with it in mind and may alter the experience, but at least you had the option to bring back the arguably better system that Ubisoft seems to endless amounts of hate for.

Lastly i want to take some time to address the die-hard defenders of this game

Pros:
+ Overall, Shadow have some improve compare to RPG Assassin's Creed games recently, its not perfect but feel good to play
+ Graphic and Environment is breathalking, Trees and foliages move with dynamic wind and weather feel amazing
+ Stealth action with Naoe feel smooth and satisfy, she move and kill fast with style (Best part to enjoy)
+ Combat is simple and easy but feel good in actions, animations and impacts is well done 
+ Chacracter progesion is good, you can build you character fit with your gameplay style

Cons:
- Storytelling and dialogues suck
- Music suck
- Open world Activities is bland, get repetitive and boring with time as usual
- You cant change day times, sometime game got too dark at night and hurt visibility hard
- Yasuke character is dont need at all, Naoe can do both steath and combat totaly fine , Yasuke combat force gameplay is boring , he cant parkour and move slow too, who want play this guy in a Assassin Creed game really? Yasuke story  break the pace of the game for nothing good

191397231,english,"When I heard about this game I had my doubts - mainly because ubisoft wasn't really pushing out anything great over the past few years from what I understood. I played all the early games and kinda fizzled out after Black Flag which I consider to be one of the best AC games. 

I remember though when all my friends and I back in the day would always talk about how Ubisoft should make an AC game set in Japan with samurai elements. Well this game was announced and my interest was peaked. Mind you, the last AC game I had touched was Origins, but for me that game never stuck and I only gave it a few hours. I had my reservations about stepping back into Assassins Creed but I was willing to give Shadows a shot based on the setting and the idea going around that Ubisoft really needed to step it up this year. 

Firstly, this game is absolutely beautiful on PC. This is for sure the best looking game I have played on my system. It captures the wildlife, flora and fauna, and architecture of feudal japan exceptionally well and I am impressed. Combat is insanely fun, especially with all the potential combinations you can do as you upgrade mastery perks. I found it very easy to grasp the controls and find my footing quickly. 

Once thing I wasn't expecting was the amount of content out of the gate. There is so much to explore and do around the towns and cities. I am always encountering some event, side quest, or other smaller things that don't necessarily progress the story but are a nice touch. One thing that bores me about some single-player games is that beyond the main quest within the open world there is like nothing to do or see that's worthwhile and it kind of takes me out of it. Shadows has plenty to do and I find myself moving from task to task pretty seamlessly. I think this is the reason why I play for 3 to 5 hours and don't even realize it. Yet there is still so much to discover and do. 

The story is pretty good but I have't unlocked Yasuke yet so I am interested to see how this impacts the game for better or for worse. 

I might come back to this review after some time and see how this game fully pans out. 

Honestly this might be my most played game this year. This game is a pleasant surprise from Ubisoft and I am glad they took some extra time on this game to make it right, it shows. 

Side Note: This game is really awesome when you don't have someone complaining in your ear about a woke agenda

It's definitely the sneakiest AC yet and as someone who hated the lack of it in Valhalla and Odyssey, this is an excellent return to form. If you play this accursed franchise primarily for the stealth like I do, it won't disappoint. Rarely do I feel -forced- into combat unless I actively seek it out or play as Yasuke for story segments. I'm continually impressed with the attention to detail and the NPC awareness (I play on Expert difficulty with insta assassinations enabled as a tradeoff--for AC vets I do recommend that for the most engaging experience).

Only downside is the performance. I'm on a 4080 and 7800x3d-- No matter what settings I change, it seems like it runs at the same choppy 40-80fps range depending on the location. It's worst during autumn season with all the wind and foliage causing insane frame drops for my high-end system.

191395673,english,"Hard to recommend this game at its full price tag. It's a beautiful looking game but that's about all it has going for it. It suffers from extremely easy combat, even on the hardest difficulty. You can beat the final boss of the game by chaining abilities which prevent the boss from even fighting back. 

There's way too much cut scene and dialogue bloat for the quality that the game offers. Traversal is pretty buggy especially through trees and mountains. Outside of the cooler animations there seems to be parkour functionality regression from previous AC titles. The AI is really bad and will often times just stop what they're doing and forget you even exist. 

The introduction of Yasuke as an unlock-able/playable character is a cool concept. But they nerfed his mobility so bad compared to Naoe that you don't really have the freedom to choose to play as him unless you want to severely handicap your traversal capabilities. Ubisoft should have kept the two characters mobility the same and just kept the separate weapon arsenals.

191387646,english,"To kick this review off, it should be acknowledged that this is possibly the best most bug-free Ubisoft Launch my outdated PC has even played. To put it into perspective, I am still playing with a 1080ti and i5-6600k CPU from 8 years ago, and yet this game decides to run on max settings flawless. Usually I have fps locked at 60 and mostly pull on average 30 minimum for games, but i saw it reach 140+ in moments, and only dip when climbing the mountains, which is a topic further down. All in all, game looks beautiful, runs beautifully, making the new engine upgrade or changeover (whatever it is) a great move on Ubisoft's part. Now onto the rest of the review;

The Good
-Visuals, they have outdone themselves in not only quality, but quantity of assets as their are so much foliage that when straying off the beaten path you vision is obstructed.
-Combat, is as fun and diverse as can be as combat gameplay is divided between the 2 characters, but each pulling their own strengths and weaknesses. Do i want to go in loud and proud as the tanky Yasuke? Or quiet and deadly as the girl? (forgot her name, starts with N)
-Unique assassination targets. I love the board that fills up with organisations and targets for us to track down and hunt. They took a mechanic they introduced in the Avatar game of theirs and used it here very well. Being able to stumble upon one of these targets, nose diving into a conspiracy or picking it up the natural way feels great, and each offers their own unique reward and contribution to the underlining narrative of the setting. 
-Destruction. You can destroy fences, cut through bamboo trees, bushes and clear anything thats not an adult tree. Panel walls. The world is more interactive in this sense then Ghost of Tsushima. Granted, Tsushima still stands out in its unique vibrancy even tho it loses a point to AC Shadow in visual density. 

The Not-so Good
-Button Layouts. As the games progressed, we changed from having X to attack, and Y to parry, and run/parkour being held on LT (xbox scheme), to now having the layout change entirely with every new iteration of the game, squeezing in more and more functions tied to a single button, or having a button when held open up a command wheel. The command wheel is fine, but having multiple functions tied to a single button creates issues. For example, RB and RT are light and heavy attacks, and assassinate is RB, well because assassinate shares a trigger with a normal attack, sometimes even if you are prompted with an assassinate option ingame, and you press RB, you instead do a normal attack ruining whatever stealth momentum you had built up at that point. Y being the button to loot and interact with everything, with soft and hard looting for some reason, hard looting being you have to HOLD Y to interact with chests and containers....Now i have no problem with the HOLD to Open a new command wheel function, as those buttons aren't given any other use outside of that HOLD function, and give you more options.
-Senses, there are 2 of them. You hold LT, and your vision zooms in a bit as gold/white/blue orbs appear (indication loot, discoverable, quest related) and enemies you visually see are marked. Then you have the classic assassin sense which you HAVE TO HOLD DOWN THE RIGHT JOYSTICK to trigger and disable.....Also, Yasuke doesn't have access to assassins sense, so yeah. But anyways, why did they waste 2 separate buttons to make these 2 separate types of senses? this could have been one sense, that evolves as you go, but their are next to no upgrades except for the girl, where targets are marked red for a bit longer. But they work together anyways, like if you turn on assassin sense and hold LT, you can mark red enemies through walls that you could only mark with LT if you could see them, but Assassin sense bypasses that....
-Also, when you kill a unique NPC, it goes into this slow japanese tapestry filter of white, and black ink that looks really cool....why couldn't they use this filter for Assassin's Sense instead of just putting on a terrible grey filter? Like do you know how cool and unique it would be if the world looked like a tapestry with but feint red brushstrokes indicating enemies? They missed out. 
-The world is detailed, but lifeless. There are so many temples and shrines taking up space that you can't do anything. Most of the game is areas where you interact with a few things, or collect a few scrolls and that's it, they don't offer any reason to go back unless a mission brings you there. And i get it if they are limited in what you can do and don't want to risk causing to much outrage with japan with players desecrating temples etc.....but i feel like we are already way passed that point now. And you have some NPC's here or their wandering, but barely. Even random events like peasants in need of assistance do not happen enough to utilize their reward mechanic of replenishing scouts or gaining intel. And if you go off the paths, most of the world is just densed foliaged mountains with nothing on them, that have steep hills forcing to to slide all the way down unless you Skyrim-style horse climb, and for what? It is an interesting way to not use invisible walls, but why decorate so much useless space that you obviously don't want players to explore? 
-Nothing is hunting you. Atleast in the previous titles there were people after you, or thieves cunning enough to steal from you, the world felt alive. And in this game, there is non of that. Your actions do not seam to affect the world, you aren't clearing areas of their corruption, or anything. Outside of visuals and combat, the general reactiveness of the world has actually been downgraded in comparison to previous titles, and it shows. There are wandering Ronin that attack you on site after act 1, and bandits that ambush you at specific spots, but that's it. Nothing is hunting you, as you are the only hunter, and it adds to the emptiness of the game. 

All in all. the game is good and fun. And i recommend it. But they still have a long way to go, and i hope Ubisoft sees this games success as something to learn by, and need to compress the AC experience a bit more. These wide open world experiences do not fit, as they always sacrifice one content type for the expansive experience. And that just sets us back instead of taking us forward. Mirage was well down in world and gameplay, but lacked in story, but they need to go back to such formulas. Open worlds only work if you are utilizing the spaces you are offering, in which case they aren't, as the open space is just a time waster for travelling until you unlock fast travel nodes.

It's been 8 years since Origins, which is still the best RPG Assassin's Creed. AC2 to AC Unity was 5 years with an unbelievable amount of evolution and improvement. What has happened to this franchise man. They obviously can't please everyone with AC nowadays so why not just create a separate IP to explore these gorgeous empty historical set pieces and return the AC franchise to its linear action adventure glory.

191364192,english,"I would like to start by saying I've been playing these games since forever and AC2 is arguably my favorite game of all time. I wasn't initially happy with the switch to the RPG style of gameplay (though Origins is a fantastic game), and I especially didn't enjoy the majority of my time with Valhalla, so trust me when I say that I think this is the best AC game in the last ten years.

This is by far the best implementation of the two-protagonist system that they've been trying to do since Syndicate, and the difference in gameplay loops for Naoe and Yasuke allow for a fantastic bridge between old and new assassin's creed. The stealth and parkour that Naoe can do, while not as good as Unity, are the closest they have been in a long time. Yasuke, on the other hand, allows for the more hack-and-slash combat from the more recent games which is honestly pretty fun. I was surprised how much I liked switching between the two, to the point where I would more or less swap for every other mission. This game is also visually stunning. I really love the addition of changing seasons which really help to make things feel more vibrant as you go throughout the game. 

That being said, I do still have some problems with this game. The biggest one for me is the quality of acting and animation in many of the in-game cut-scenes and dialogue segments. Ever since AC has widened their scope with Origins, it seems that they use less and less motion capture for their cut-scenes, which can make npcs feel stiff and robotic at times. Also, in the english dub, the quality of voice acting for npcs varies drastically, with many highs and lows (imo the main characters thankfully give very good performances). Another result of the scope of this games is that it compromises the story. While this games ends up with a story that I did end up getting quite invested in, it's divvied up into small pieces throughout the game instead of holding one strong linear narrative (similar to Valhalla and Odyssey). 

All in all, I very much enjoyed this game and definitely recommend it if you are a fan of the series or have an interest in this period of Japanese history.",True,0,1,1743150809,76561198106354465,4094

My favorite in the series has always been Assassin’s Creed III – something about the setting and the protagonist, Connor, really stuck with me. But Shadows might just be my new top pick.

This game is, simply put, a work of art. The graphics are absolutely stunning – truly next-gen. The attention to detail in feudal Japan is breathtaking, from the sweeping landscapes and dynamic weather to the intricate architecture and ambient sound design. It’s clear the developers poured their hearts into this world.

What really elevates Assassin’s Creed Shadows, though, is how it refines and expands on the franchise’s core gameplay. The dual protagonist system, blending Naoe’s stealth with Yasuke’s raw power, creates a versatile and deeply engaging combat experience. I love how you’re constantly switching tactics – slipping through shadows one moment, then going full force in a tank-like charge the next. It’s not just about mindless action; you’re forced to think strategically, upgrade your skills, and really master both playstyles.

The stealth mechanics are better than ever. They’ve been fine-tuned to feel fluid and rewarding, with more tools, smarter AI, and a greater emphasis on timing and planning. On the other hand, the more direct combat feels weighty and impactful. Whether you’re infiltrating a fortress at night or clashing with enemies head-on in broad daylight, every encounter feels meaningful.

Ignore the negativity – this isn’t a game that deserves to be dismissed. It’s a bold, beautiful, and brilliantly crafted addition to the series. Ubisoft took a risk here, and it paid off. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is absolutely worth your time and money. If you appreciate a mix of stealth, action, and immersive storytelling, this one’s for you.",True,0,5,1743140113,76561198301925422,6355

191354266,english,"[h1]The greatest Ubisoft game in years, which is not saying much[/h1]

I don’t have it in me for a 8000 characters review today guys, so let’s do the bullet points: 

- The game is still full of bugs, crashes, glitches, things that don’t work and other shenanigans, which is ridiculous given it was delayed twice for polish

- A samurai character/dual protagonists was unnecessary and led to stealth mechanics/castle infiltration being less of a focus than it could’ve and should’ve been

- The “discovery tour” with activities and minigames full of QTEs is tedious and disrespectful of player’s time, while mandatory as progression is gated by it

- While seasons, day/night cycle and shadows are nice additions, ultimately it’s just a gimmick as it has no major impact on the game and you can’t plan around it either

- Parkour is very limited, yellow paint of handholding everywhere, which feels like a major missed opportunity for an AC game

- Hideout building had potential for an engaging Fallout 4-like gameplay loop, however it’s unimpactful and is mostly an endgame affair

- The story is dull, the main villain is immediately obvious, and choice is an illusion

- Every side quest is literally “kill 100 bandits” and “pray at 63 road shrines”, I’m not sure whether I should feel amused or insulted

- Female sumo fighters and transgender ronin are out of place, and I’m tired of still having to see this in my games in 2025

I will say the dialogue is not well done, except for Yasuke, who has great dialogue. If you turn on ""immersive mode"" then the dialogue is in Japanese and sounds pretty nice. Also another thing going around online: Yasuke is NOT gay. I dunno why everyone is saying he his. You get to choose who to romance. All in all, good return to form from Ubisoft.

191352764,english,"Absolutely phenomenal, especially with the release state of the game. This game did get a ton of backlash during development, but they COOKED with this one. I bought this 24 hours after release, and it had 3,500 reviews with an 82% positive rate (very positive). Today marks the game being out for a week and it's still 82% positive with over 11,000 reviews. According to 2 articles posted today (March 27), the game is the franchise's second most successful launch, and has over 3 million players. the games been out for a WEEK. Given the criticism's that the game's faced by content creators, I'd like to address the most common ones especially having played every previous Assassin's Creed. 

[hr][/hr]
[h2]Common Criticisms[/h2]

[u]1. ""Microtransactions""[/u] while I understand this gripe, you're not experiencing any FOMO by choosing not to pay for them. Gear you can find at the beginning of the game is very easily comparable and for many, outperform stuff you can buy. I got a chest-piece within the first 5 minutes of playing the open-world that has the trait ""throw a Kunai at a nearby enemy (killing them) whenever you perform an assassination"" which I haven't taken off (there's a mechanic for leveling your gear with you). That, and anything that can be purchased in the microtransaction store can also be acquired by using the game's free battlepass. By completing tiers, you get specialized currency that can be used to purchase items that are on both a daily and weekly rotational system. So, even if there's something you're just itching for in that store, you can easily obtain it by playing the game.

[u]2. ""Repetitive Combat""[/u] someone's clearly never played the last 4 Assassin's Creeds. The combat in Origins, Valhalla, and Mirage were mid at BEST. Odyssey, was the only decent combat in the last few games, and it took a while to get to the point where the combat didn't feel like a pre-school slap-fest. Comparatively, this game's combat is a halfway between the mechanics in Odyssey, with the can-of-whoopass animations in Assassin's Creeds 3 and 4. Seriously, in the first 5 minutes of combat, I was decapitating people! Overall gameplay-wise, this game very heavily encourages and rewards the stealthy (Assassin) playstyle contrary to previous games. In Odyssey, I very quickly got to a point where I ran into a restricted zone, started a mass-fight, and kept doing that. In this, while you can still ""do"" that, it's much easier and the environments have been very carefully crafted and tailored to promote and optimize the stealth playstyle.

[u]3. ""Poor optimization""[/u] cap. Absolute CAP. My system specs are below, but in general most of my components are 2-3 generations behind the newest components. I mean, I've got friends who're playing MH: Wilds and are having issues with the game crashing and/or less than 60 fps without frame generation. Shadows has never crashed for me, haven't touched any of my graphics settings (aside from motion blur) and I'm getting at least 70 fps regardless of what I've been doing in the game. The only minor bug I had was occasionally the sheath for my character's sword would disappear after fast traveling, but it was easily fixed by unequipping and re-equipping the weapon, and I'm 90% sure was patched in the hotfix two days ago.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]Added features to this game that I really enjoy[/h2]

[u]1. Implementation of seasons.[/u] Different seasons affect your gameplay. For example, in the Winter your movement speed can be decreased by walking through deep snow. Ponds and lakes are frozen over, allowing for you to walk (wobble) across them.

[u]2. Added movement, weapon, and gameplay mechanics.[/u] Unlike previous games, you get to fully prone in this game. Some shrubbery you'll be able to crouch to be hidden, others you'll need to go prone through. Entering buildings can also be achieved by going prone many times. Both characters have a variety of weapon types to choose from (can have 2 equipped), each with their own specialty and gameplay benefit. For example, if you want to perform double assassinations, the Tanto knife will need to be 1 of your 2 equipped weapons on that character. Each character you play as will also have different bonuses and detriments to their kit. The combat focused character is slower, harder and slower to parkour with, but has more capacity for adrenaline moves and can run through barricades. The stealth focused character is less easily seen, faster, and has some absolutely BEAUTIFUL movement and parkour animations, but at the cost of in-combat capabilities. 

There are plenty of other things that I'm thrilled with about the game, many of which showcased in previous ones like the absolute beauty of the open-world, capacity to explore and randomly come across quests and steps both story and non-story, customization, transmogrification, gear upgrading and improvement, but better to see these for yourself.

The takeaways I do have:
-Parkour is very meh, it's not very deep but does have some flare and is fast enough (for Naoe anyway)
-Yasuke feels very uninteresting to play, but I think that's more because he doesn't fit my personal fantasy. His inability to parkour well is probably the most damning part of his gameplay for me.
-Story (so far) is kind of whatever, the japanese and portugese VAs are fairly solid for the most part and sell scenes well. It does what it needs to do to get me killing people. The end of act 1 was actually some pretty good stuff.
-Stealth is actually pretty engaging as Naoe. On the expert difficulty it can be a bit tough at times. The lack of social stealth sucks massively, but the new lighting system makes up for it fairly well.
-Enemies inability to climb at all makes any kind of chase almost non-existent, which is a shame
-The regional wanted system can be a bit frustrating, especially as someone who does not enjoy playing Yasuke. I think some more ways to address it (ie. tearing down wanted posters) would be good and make the system more interactive

191350585,english,"I have been a super fan of this series ever since day 1. Seeing the state that the game is in now is incredibly depressing. I'll try to keep it brief...

Positives: 
-Top tier graphics if you can run it (my 4070 did fine on ultra, unsure about console or older cards)
-World building was pretty good in my opinion 
-I had very few issues with bugs 
-gameplay was smooth and seemed to work as intended (unfortunately whats intended is subpar but ill get to that)

Negatives:
- The story overall has almost zero redeeming qualities. Any good parts are overshadowed by either HORRIBLE voice lines, bad writing, or incredibly mediocre character body and/or face animations (I have no clue why they moved away from motion capture.
- Combat I thought was fluid but Incredibly repetitive, I mostly played as Naoe and can only remember two take downs/ executions that repeat over and over and over and over.... (how many times am i going to do the same flip over someone and cut their throat with the sword????)
- All side content, mainly the castles are ALL the EXACT SAME with no variability at all. They were boring after completing 2 or 3 and trying to find the samurai daimyo to kill became an annoying chore to find them just to get it over as fast as possible.
- P2W sucks. Not the worst thing for some people but a negative overall. It should never overpower items from grinding the actual game.

Alot of the games short comings arent as apparent unless you have played previous titles because its biggest issues for me come from things that have already existed in the past but are no longer seen in game. Too many to go into, this is already long enough but a major example are the takedowns/executions. Just look at how many different sword takedowns existed in Black Flag compared to the same 2 repeated by each character in this game.

The game is shamelessly designed in a way that keeps players grinding for hours and hours just to maliciously push players into buying their micro-transactions, like in mmos or gachas.  The fact that a SINGLE-PLAYER game has a PAID battle pass already tells me the company doesn't value their customers and plans on milking every dollar out of them.  Ngl, I did have fun for the first few hours running around, clearing camps, collecting loot, farming knowledge points, etc.  But the grind became unbearable and the game ends up becoming a farming ""podcast checklist"" game, like what odyssey/valhalla was to me.  Another system of the game that I didn't like was the dual character system.  I found it annoying switching back and forth between characters and going into a loading screen just to use another weapon like the bow or the naginata.  Sure you may argue that it isn't realistic for Naoe to carry those due to her size but it's a game, limiting choices is almost always a bad idea.  All in all, I regret buying this at full price.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivers everything we hoped for and more!

The dual protagonist system is a game-changer playing as both the stealthy shinobi and the powerful samurai offers incredible variety in gameplay.

Combat is fluid and satisfying, blending fast-paced katana duels with intense parkour and silent assassinations. The RPG elements are well-balanced, offering deep customization and meaningful progression. The attention to detail, from the dynamic weather to the cultural authenticity, is simply unmatched.

191347076,english,"I'm really enjoying this game. Naoe is fun to control and really makes you feel like you're an Assassin (I haven't gotten far enough to play Yasuke). The Parkour could use some work though, something similar to Unity's High Profile i think would have worked a lot better. Furthermore the world outside of towns could use some more parkour features like in the older games. The grappling hook is a nice addition though and makes it fun and easy to traverse the world (without feeling like a patch like in Syndicate).

One thing i think Ubisoft needs to let go is the RPG mechanics. They're one of the weakest points in my opinion and really get annoying, especially when you start getting into percents.

The world is really pretty, and the towns are fun to navigate. Like i said, nature could use some work, but in the moments it really counts the Parkour pulls through. I like walking places just so i can see the sights though, because their are some genuinely gorgeous sights to take in, and the seasons system helps make it even prettier.

The base building mechanic is fun too. Having grownup on Fire Emblem Fates, which had a similar system, i really like this method of execution.

191346014,english,"Really cool game, dont listen to the hate that its getting online most of it is not valid, however there are things that this game does EGREGIOUSLY:

1. Impossible Terrain 
The terrain in this game is BRUTAL to travel through, essentially forcing you to travel on roads exclusively; making things immensely tedious and take longer than it should otherwise. Brush is too thick to see anything if you stray from roads and most of the time you end up having to backtrack because you run into a mountain that is just not climbable (this is assassin's creed btw MOST things should be climbable).

2. Exploration/ Points of Interest 
In this game, they remove a key part of synchronization points that has been a part of every assassin's creed game since 2007: unlocking poi's. You have to make the near impossible trek to said synchronization point (unless of course you found the single mountain road to and from it) and all this does is give you a fast travel point that you will use MAYBE once...that's it. It removes a VERY small section of the maps fog (maybe a 150 meters around it) and gives you the poi's in that area...the other 40 pois in this region that arent right next to a syn point??? Oh well, too bad, you gotta travel through this horrid terrain and walk every inch of the map to find some of these pois and there is just no reason for this, i get wanting to explore i love that part of open world games but it is just not fun to do in this game. Make a setting that i can turn on that is ""show pois"" or something which dives directly into point #3 which is the worst of the bunch

3. Putting gameplay systems that have always been in the series behind a pay wall
This is Ubisoft we're talking about we shouldnt be surprised, and im fairly certain this isnt even the first time a ""Map Bundle"" has been put in the game before. HOWEVER, in previous games the sync points allowed you to explore and still have a way to see everything without wasting your time. Now? They removed the sync points showing poi's and then put them behind a $10 bundle. I like touching all the things, i like 100%ing these games, but now if i dont want to spend dozens of hours just walking this horrid map to find every poi i have to pay this greedy ass company 10 more dollars on top of the 70 the game costs? Actually ridiculous.

4. Yasuke (not in the way you think)
I hate the dual protagonist format where one is a brute and one is the stealthy assassin. I hated it in syndicate, but at least jacob had the choice to be assassin like and could still do everything in the game evie could with small gameplay tweaks. I play these games to be a stealthy assassin so i dont care for the ""brute"" characters, but Yasuke takes it to the next level. He cant climb, he cant stealth, yes he has more hp and does more damage but for the trade off of not being able to play the video game in every instance other than combat? its just not worth playing him. I think Yasuke is a super interesting part of this story and that its fine they made him a part of it but i dont think him being a playable character was the way to do it, make him like a more important junjiro or tomiko, but not a playable brute main character that cant do most things.

5. Base Design
Nothing much to say, your hideout is cool in concept just needs to qol tweaks because its rough to use right now.


BUT THIS GAME ALSO DOES STUFF REALLY WELL:

1. Combat
Combat in this game is actually super super fun HUGE upgrade from valhalla and even mirage, especially once you start getting masteries. The different weapons are really cool and unique and fun to use for both characters. The AI is pretty bad all things considered but you're having such a fun time you dont really mind. 

2. Animations and Visuals
HOLY THIS GAME LOOKS SO GOOD, even on medium settings this game looks PHENOMENAL. The fighting and parkour animations are also a HUGE upgrade from any game previous in the series. 

3. Story
Even 30 hours in this game has a really compelling story for both characters. When i first started i was worried about how they were going to get Yasuke on Naoe's side and it make sense but they really sold me with the reasoning behind it. Character's motivations both main and said are very thought out and interesting.

4. Scouts
This is 100% the best part exploration wise in this game, i like not having a big marker that says ""HEY QUEST OBJECTIVE HERE"" and that they give hints as to where to go and you can find the general area and scout it out for an exact location. They also are a much better way of getting resources imo, instead of going around and finding random trees to press e on, you can mark resources at forts and camps for your scouts to take, MUCH more interesting concept.


TL;DR
Terrain and exploration really really struggle in this game and classic Ubisoft removed functions that have always been a part of these games and then put them behind a pay wall. But the combat is SUPER fun in this game, it looks STUNNING, the story is solid and thought out for once and they HAVE added gameplay mechanics that are much better than previous games. Game def needs polish but i think worth the buy especially if its on sale and after a little while to see what ubisoft does (if anything at all) with player input.

It's not that it's bad (though it does have some really awful design choices), it's just uninspired. To be fair, I got farther in Shadows than I did in Mirage (now that is a craptastic game). Maybe I'll try it again in a few patches, but if the first patch was any indication (photo mode fixes, really?) I'm not hopeful.

The cash shop stuff has been mentioned a million times so I'm not going to repeat it here.

Pros
- Naoe and Yasuke have very different playstyles; which is refreshing.
- The graphics are nice if you care about that sort of thing.
- The hideout management was kinda neat (outside of the cost).

Cons
- Battle Pass reward tracks. What?
- Notifications and tips can't be turned completely off for some reason. 
- All of the cons revolve around the same issues that have plagued AC games since forever. Poor stealth, poor stealth detection, poor parkour, poor combat, unresponsive controls. Essentially all of the details that AC hinges on.
- The wanted system. How in the holy blue Japanese hell does an entire province know instantly that I'm wanted? In 1579.
- While cool, Yasuke takes a a backseat to the ACTUAL assassin, Naoe. Unless forced, there really is no reason to play Yasuke.
- Why do developers/publishers think it's a good idea to slow travel down to a crawl in towns?
- Why is there no auto-travel on horseback?
- Hideout stuff costs way too much. This is AC, not an incremental resource collecting sim.
- Why can I only dismantle/sell one item at a time AND need to wait for a message popup to disappear before selecting the next item? Seriously, who thought that was a good idea?
- Seasons are annoying. Especially winter. More slow movement? Heck yeah.
- No way to switch the day/night cycle. Don't tell me how to play the game.

In my opinion Shadows is better than Valhalla - which was a bit too dark for my taste, and Sigurd descending into madness while acting like a little b*tch just rubbed me the wrong way. However, I think it's struggling to be as good as Odyssey which won me over with its delightful sense of humor. If that sense of humor isn't your cup of tea, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the tone of Shadows, which is more middle of the road while trying very hard to honor Japanese culture and its strong emphasis of honor, balance, tradition, and respect.

I like the two main characters a lot, and getting to explore feudal Japan is *chef's kiss*. The supporting cast is strong and well worth investing time and attention into.

The storytelling is superb, there's lots of twists and turns, it's hitting lots of the right emotional tones, and also doing really well at exploring the class struggles and warlord culture Japan's people at the time were forced to function in. I love that there is not just one faction of ""big bads"" to chase down, but multiple, with lots of different threads to follow. The zones are very fun to explore, and the graphics and cinematics are just plain gorgeous.

191339420,english,"I really like the game. The gameplay is solid, I experience no issues with combat input, the moves are fluid and connect in mostly satisfying ways with few exceptions. The options for combat are varied and interesting, the roles it pushes you into are fun to switch between and utilize for their strengths (heavy combat encounters w/multiple enemies for Yasuke and single encounters, stealth and assassination for Naoe). I'd say combat so far is 8.5 or a 9/10. Definitely more nuanced than most games and AT LEAST on par with Ghost of Tsushima. I have found it challenging  and rewarding. for some movements and combat finishers both characters look really cool while you fight and the skills are also awesome.
The stealth system is the best it's ever been when you're using Naoe. 9/10 imo. I have seen clips of people exploiting glitches but these people are definitely really trying to find ways the game fails, none of that stuff will happen to a noticeable degree organically.
The gear system is ok, I wish they could do something more intricate but what we have works. I do wish you could equip all of Naoe's weapons at the same time, but you have to choose 2 out of the 3 which isn't bad but could easily be all 3. The gear all looks really good and allows for more nuanced builds for those that like to do that. 7.5/10
Travel is a 7.5/10 for me, because it's easy to get around and the parkour system is pretty solid, there are some things I don't like. The trees become very dense in some areas and hills too steep to climb which can be annoying but if I'm being honest it's still a reasonable barrier to have. What I don't like is that you can't really climb trees anymore, there are still some you can traverse but there are a lot you'd think you could but can't, they almost make up for that by letting me chop bamboo fields apart like I've always wanted to since watching Ninja Scroll as a kid, and plenty of assassin safe houses and view points you can fast travel to after you unlock them. Also the .5 added because Naoe has awesome animations for some movements.
The story is decent, revenge arc and building an organization that will become a major part of the Assassins.
8.5/10 for story 
Shadows also gives you a home base to customize and it's easily the best one yet. There's a lot of options for both placement of buildings and fauna as well as what you build to include customizing the looks of the buildings. I'd say it's 9.5/10 on that aspect. 

Overall the game is an 8.7/10 for me, a lot to love, a lot that is mid, but very very little that's actually bad. For comparison I'd say Black Flag is 9.2/10, Odyssey an 8.8/10 and Mirage is a 6/10
It's leagues better than Mirage and so far despite ranking Odyssey higher I'm finding more enjoyable overall than Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins.

191339299,english,"It's.... just okay. I consider myself to be thoroughly whelmed. 

Just like previous entries in the modern AC series, nothing it does is outright ""bad"", but nothing really stands out as great either. 

The biggest issues stem from Ubisoft's ""quantity over quality"" approach to open world design. The map is GIGANTIC but it never really takes advantage of this space, instead choosing copy/paste POIs of largely mindless, tedious tasks to fill the space just like previous entries. There's no hunting or fishing or herbalism or mining or really anything to do at all in the open world beyond getting to the next POI, so there's no incentive to explore. You will spend hours upon hours of your playthrough on your horse running to the next objective since everything is so spread out. There are something like 50+ towns in the game, but if you showed me a picture of one of the towns and asked me to name it, I likely wouldn't be able to. You spend so little time in each and they all have such similar architecture that they all blend together. I really think they would've been better off with a map that's 1/4 the size but had far more effort put into making that space interesting.

The other big flaw with Shadow's design is the checklist approach to the main quest structure. The beginning and end of the story is interesting, Yasuke's personal questline being a highlight, but the whole midgame section is a slog. Because the targets in the main quest can largely be tackled in any order, nothing plot-relevant can actually happen during these assassinations. This results in the story feeling stagnant for about 90% of it excepting the beginning and end. I would've preferred to see a more linear narrative which would've allowed the writers to write a story that progresses more naturally. 

There are some things I did like about this game though. It's quite pretty, definitely the best looking AC game to date. There is far less level-gating than previous titles, and you can progress the main story without being forced to do too much side content. There are these mini-hideouts in just about every town which, for a small fee, you can unlock and fast travel to(among other things), which results in you needing to scale far fewer towers just to get fast travel points. Crawling and the grappling hook are good additions, and they really help make that ninja fantasy work. You only need to complete the main quest, the character personal quests, and Junjiro's questline to get the epilogue, unlike previous entries which demanded a lot of additional effort.

As far as recommending it goes, if you liked the previous entries, you'll probably like this, but if you didn't like the previous entries, you probably won't like this as it suffers from many of the same flaws of the previous titles. If you are interested in picking this up, I certainly don't recommend paying full price - wait until this goes on sale for <$30.",False,0,0,1743119038,76561197969897685,4325

191338253,english,"I feel like any review on this game is sort of controversial I guess. So this comes from a guy who thought:
Origins was okay
Odyssey was a slight improvement but over bloated with content
And Valhalla was just awful (only AC I haven't finished) ,lets not count Mirage

Is this game perfect? no, am i finding the game fun? big fat yes on that
IMO this includes some of the best stealth in an AC game to date, and some of the best combat to go with it. Yes the story inst great because of its design (loads of target on a board go get them in any order) but the core combat loop is so fun. All the weapons are fun and interesting to use. The idea of having two characters keeps the game play loop fresh. 

I'm 40hrs in and while I feel like this games predecessors didn't respect nor deserve the time needed to beat them, instead I just want this one to keep on going.

191317051,english,"After putting 30 hours into this game, I cannot recommend it to anyone. 

From the jump, this game starts with 1.5 hours of cutscenes and 20 minutes of gameplay. I spent more time with my controller on the desk and watching characters talk in the first 5 hours of the game than actually playing it. Once the prologue is cleared and you have access to the world, it is enjoyable for a while. Your first shrine, temple, and castle all feel like worthwhile achievements. However, after your 10th iteration of these ""activities"" facing the exact same bosses, with chests in the exact same locations, and retrieving the exact same scrolls, it loses all of it's charm. These side activities are tied to your knowledge points which are tied to your abilities. To even unlock the first set, you have to grind for HOURS. Literal hours. Go get those scrolls, go kill those identical castle bosses, go pray at the same shrines. This game gate-keeps you from progressing by forcing you to do arbitrary/repetitive tasks for dozens of hours to simply unlock the next progression tier. 

The combat is also bare-bones. No combos. No move-sets. Just light, heavy, and charged light/heavy. That is it. Enemies use the same 2-3 attacks, and you simply press a button to dodge, or parry and then light/heavy. Enemies that are a single level above you feel like floor bosses from an MMORPG. Enemies that are the same level feel like damage sponges from a crappy RPG boss mechanic. 

Naoe is this games one, true, protagonist. Not because Yasuke isn't cool or fun to play but simply because Naoe can do everything. Yasuke has his perks, for sure. There are times where I find myself just wanting to charge in a castle and take on everyone, not having to worry about being hit twice and then dying. But the fun stops there with Yasuke. Yasuke has been nerfed so hard in the core mechanics of stealth, parkour, jumping, and climbing, that Naoe just feels better to play. Naoe sacrifices raw survivability and damage in order to be an assassin in a *ding ding* assassin's game. Yasuke's only viable gameplay purpose is to fight high HP bosses or enemies.

This game also has a shop. Go figure. You can buy weapons and outfits that will make you more powerful. You can skip the hideout resource grind by simply paying $10 for a pack. You can even purchase a map reveal pack. This pack will reveal ALL of the knowledge point activities. Instead of grinding and exploring for dozens of hours, you can just skip that by paying $10. The game's economy is restrictive and slowed down to encourage you to spend money. Hideout resources are intentionally scarce so that you can either grind for hours upon hours for a single upgrade, or you can just swipe your credit card in the shop.

I have played 30 hours. I have 100% the first 2 areas (provinces) in the game. I have just now (as of 25 hours) unlocked Yasuke and his story. Of those 30 hours, only 5-6 were spent on the story and it's missions/cutscenes. The rest were spent doing the busy work I just described. This game, while extremely pleasing to the eye, is nothing more than a busy work simulator, thinly covered by a lackluster story with robotic and unnatural dialogue, characters who have no REAL depth, and a world that feels tedious and very unrewarding to explore.

***EDIT*** 
Since the commenter underneath this review is unable to use basic reading comprehension skills I will say this. I have no issue exploring an open world. I enjoyed walking around and seeing the world's beauty. However, that can only get you so far when the rewards for exploring are lackluster OR it takes you so long during the course of your exploration that a major reward feels as if it didn't meet the effort taken to get there.",False,0,1,1743098694,76561199141698246,1824

191316940,english,"Ok, so, here is my review for this game. In short, it is an absolute success in my book. 

First, I have a 5 years old laptop with gtx 1650 4gb vram and 16gb ddr. 
I was flabbergasted to see that I can actually run the game, and no, it is not a slideshow. It runs decent. Above 30fps on low settings and of course, frame generation. For me, this is top notch optimization. And the experience has been bug free so far. I am around 50 hours into the game.

Graphics - are, as much as my hardware allows, great. I played Valhalla for almost 200 hours and although I loved the game, facial animations were bad. Very little emotional expression. Here however, I felt almost every emotion on character's faces as they were conveying the message. It is absolutely improved compared to the other AC rpg games (I also loved Odyssey facial expressions). The environment looks great and invites me to explore.

Controls - some people say they are clunky. For me, they were responsive and not clunky. Naoe and Yasuke, the way I feel them, move naturally and with inertia that is expected from a lighter (Naoe) and heavier (Yasuke) human body. The only time I felt they were ""clunky"" was when I was, as Naoe, surronded by 5+ enemies and was panicking to scramble and survive and in that hectic experience pressed wrong buttons, leading to defeat.  

Combat - though deceptively simple, was complex and satisfying for me, because I was discovering different moves (through progression), which added to the tactical element, especially with Naoe, because she is somewhat more vulnerable than Yasuke. Enjoyed the mechanic where the armor needs to be chipped off to hurt the enemy. Of course, most Naoe's hits don't make enemies flich, whereas Yasuke's do. That is also a nice detail to combat. With Naoe, you need to be on your toes a bit more, due to that. 

Music - was great, for the most part. The only thing I found ""cringe"" were scenes in animations when a karaoke style music similar to Yakuza games started playing. That kicked me out of immersion. Otherwise, world music, sneaking music and partially combat music was great (apart from some songs with a hip hop style during combat, but I did missions which were, I think, more suited to Yasuke and that specific music was for him - what I loved as a small detail, however, was that in his music, I heard an instrument known as ""berimbau"" in Brasil, which was used by slaves during the game of Capoeira during slavery and colonisation of Brasil - a very nice touch).

Voice acting - I started with immersive mode, where everybody spoke in portuguese and japanese. However, after hearing Yasuke speak japanese, I didn't like it, because it sounded like a different voice than when he is speaking portuguese. So, I switched to english. Loved his voice becasue it reminded me of Bayek a bit, my favorite character in the whole franchise. I must say, I found the dialogs very good. Wasn't bothered at all. In fact, I noticed that japanese characters , because they can't pronounce the letter ""L"", were using kind of like a rolling ""R"", which I instantly liked, because, if you watch some japanese videos where they are trying to speak english, that is the same pronounciation. To me, that was authentic and didn't spoil my immersion. Very much liked both english and immersive voiceovers. 

Now, about ""wokeness"", DEI and SJW. I haven't played enough to say anything about that, but, according to some videos I watched, same sex relationships are optional. I don't know what the fuss is all about, since I clearly remember a side quest in Odyssey where I could, in order to complete the quest, have sex with a blacksmith, as Alexios. The dialoge was hillarious, so I went with it. Besides, every game the so called ""haters"" and gaming ""purists"" play is also very much woke, DEI and SJW, because the very heroes they play are there with a mission to fight for freedom against oppression of expression, equality and justice. 

I guess people are triggered by a female ninja and a black samurai, who may, or may have not been a samurai, and this is where historical accuracy accusations appear. Ridiculous, because as I start the game, in the provided text as it is booting up, it informs the player about historical fiction. And I believe this is what was written in all of AC games, if I am not mistaken. It is a game, for god's sake. Fiction. If you want history, watch history channel. 

This is my take. The way I see it, game is doing well and is absolutely success and one of the best AC games I played (yes, I played from AC1 till now and no, I don't like Ezio). 

If I need to slap a score, the game is a 9/10 for me.",True,0,1,1743098593,76561198322338514,3039

191315435,english,"I personally feel like the combat in Assassins Creed Shadows is a blend of the original combat with the 'Parry, Counter attack' Method and RPG Combat. Stealth is amazing, Naoe is quick and agile and can get in and out of Castles without being seen. Yasuke is the brute, if you need someone killed and you failed to get the Assassination, Tactical retreat to switch to Yasuke. 

- The Scenery is Gorgeous, by far one of the best scenery since probably RDR2. 
- I will always love, how a lot of the minor targets can just be found throughout the world even if you dont have the correspondant quest yet. ""Who are you people vibes"" when you kill a target that you have no idea who and why theyre uniquely named. 
- The Base Building feature, added on from Valhalla's Ravensthorpe, now being able to place the buildings wherever you want rather than set locations is great. 
- While the World is gorgeous with, realtime season changes and weather, I do wish there was more to do just out in the wilds.
- Minor issue, I would like the Sync points to clear away from the Fog of War on the map; Having to manually explore every inch of the map to clear the fog is a little tedious, but thats circumventilated by all the locations have a road leading to them, so the only fog that should be left are generally the mountain ranges that have nothing in them. 
- The In-Game ""battlepass"" It is completely free, All the items can be obtained throughout the game without spending a penny of real money on it. The Items it has are not better or worse than what can be obtained throught normal gameplay; the only real difference is the cosmetics of the items. They are more flashy with a red hue for bleed afinity or purple hue to poison afinity.

Very clear from the start they are not going for historical accuracy even a little bit, but the new engine and mechanics make the gameplay feel way more refreshing compared to the last few iterations of AC. The biggest downside is the ubi launcher

Edit: after playing more of the game as Naoe I can confidently say this is one of the weaker installments of the franchise. They hit the ground running at the start, but very quickly begin tripping over their own feet. 

The stealth of this game by far has the most potential, but it feels like they forgot to add elements to the map that allow you to utilize the new mechanics, and with how the towns are designed it feels like they discourage sneaking over rooftops. It's a shame considering most of the new mechanics are primarily usable on rooftops.

The combat feels like a chore every time I get pushed into it, it's possible that because I'm still early I just don't have the correct gear, however when I have to hit someone with a 30 strike combo only for them to slap me twice and kill me, it makes the game feel pretty unbalanced. I'm normally someone who enjoys a challenge, Ive played through every fromsoft game, currently working through First Berzerker, but the challenge in those games feels way more fair than in this game. I don't want to be stuck on the same regular ashigaru for 10 minutes just because hes wearing a couple pieces of armor.

The freerunning feels way more limited as well. I wonder if they were so focused on stylizing Naoes flips and spins that they forgot to make the freerunning feel... well... free. You can only run along trees they want you to run along, only climb rocks they want you to climb (complete with the stupid yellow paint markers on every tree/rock that has handholds), you get like 2 ways to infiltrate castles, everything else is just smooth walls. It really discourages you from even wanting to engage in freerunning unless absolutely necessary.

I know this is a point that way too many people have talked about, but Im going to add my two cents to the cultural respect aspect. I am aware that Ubisoft made some changes with the day 1 patch to fit more in line with Japanese values, but it feels like they really only did the bare minimum, and still dragged their feet along the way. For example, when you first pass under a torii gate, you get a message prompt saying ""to show respect for the torii gates, please do not climb on them"" But then every... single... time you pass another torii gate, it gives you a grapple prompt. Same thing happens at shrines, it feels moot to have the message there if they're going to prompt me to do the opposite every time.",False,0,0,1743085520,76561199247641021,1068

191300029,english,"Pros:
* Playing as Naoe has been the highlight so far. Her gameplay feels like the most refined stealth experience in the Assassin’s Creed series to date. It rewards patience, timing, and creative infiltration. It captures that feeling of being an assassin better than most entries in the franchise.
* Feudal Japan is beautifully realized. The environments are lush, atmospheric, and layered with small cultural details that deepen immersion like Naoe removing her shoes inside her home. Ubisoft clearly put effort into representing the setting with care and cultural nuance.
* The game feels like the successful middle ground between the original AC formula (stealth, parkour) and the RPG-heavy entries of recent years. It’s not quite as stripped down as Mirage, but it avoids the overwhelming sprawl of Odyssey.
* Despite Naoe being a squishy character, the game allows for fun build experimentation. The right gear, weapons, and skills can transform her into a deadly melee threat, which rewards experimentation without breaking her identity as a stealth-first assassin.
* The game leans into Asian-style storytelling, with slower pacing and emotionally charged, contemplative scenes. It may feel unfamiliar to some, but it fits the setting well and adds weight to the narrative.

Cons:
* While Naoe shines in stealth, Yasuke’s gameplay leans heavily into Valhalla-style combat. That shift may not be what stealth-focused fans were hoping for, though some may still enjoy his brute-force approach. It’s a tonal and mechanical departure that feels like two different games stitched together.
* Some contract missions fall into a repetitive, grindy loop. While stealth keeps them challenging and dynamic with Naoe, they can lack variety over time and risk feeling like filler.
* Naoe’s parkour movement isn't as fluid as some would prefer. It’s an improvement from the more recent titles (maybe very similar to Mirage), but those hoping for a return to Black Flag or Unity-level parkour may find it a bit stiff and inconsistent in tight situations.
* Side missions and non-combat mechanics like kuji-kiri or art interactions are slow and often feel like a break in momentum. While this reflects the storytelling traditions of the setting, it may test players looking for a faster-paced gameplay.

Overall: 
Assassin’s Creed Shadows is probably one of the strongest entries in the series in years. Naoe offers a stealth experience that rivals or surpasses past assassins, set against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted and culturally thoughtful world. It strikes a meaningful balance between the old-school AC identity and the newer RPG evolution. While Yasuke’s heavier combat feels like a nod to Valhalla and may divide opinion, it at least offers variety.

The pacing, mission design, and parkour aren’t perfect, but if stealth, exploration, and immersion are what you value in an Assassin’s Creed game, Shadows delivers. Alongside Mirage, it feels like Ubisoft is finally listening to the fanbase and re-centering the series around what made it great to begin with.",True,0,0,1743083989,76561199099788819,2080

191297895,english,"As a fan of the series(even the RPG games), I knew this game was going to be good but I didn't expect it to be this good.

In a way it is kind of annoying having two different characters that suit two vastly different play styles instead of having only one character that can do both. However, after playing the game for a while, it is actually pretty easy and fun to seamlessly change between Naoe and Yasuke for certain situations. It also doesn't feel like the game is forcing you, you have a choice between either most of the time.

The story by far is very interesting, I have been playing a lot of side content too which is very fun. I like how they have made both Yasuke and Naoe, their stories and character development is really well made. The only thing that I find a bit bad, sometimes Naoe's faciel expressions and voice lines seem a bit robotic compared to Yasuke.

As for gameplay, the more you play the better and more fun it gets since your characters level up getting more stats and such. Some abilities change the gameplay a lot, giving you an edge in some situations, for example, Naoe has an ability with the Tanto which let's you assassinate enemies while in combat, which means that even if you do not have enough level to one shot assassinate a target, after starting the combat you can finish them off with a second assassination. Compared to Valhalla these abilities are interesting and actually help you instead of just giving you more stats, Valhalla did have some interesting skills but not as much as the ones here.

Talking about Naoe, I think the stealth gameplay has never been more fun, you sprint, jump around, do flips, prone and use a variety of different tools. The thing that I like the most about the stealth is how Naoe moves, it just feels very natural and elegant. As for Yasuke, he is a pretty standard guns blazing kind of character, nothing ground breaking but he is very fun to play for people that don't want to wait and stick to shadows.

There are people who unironically pretend to be Japanese on social media to slander the game, hate the game for having watermelons and other pretty ridiculous things like disrespecting Japanese culture, while in reality the game actively pushes you and rewards you to respect shrines and not climb tori gates and even removes your shoes while you are in some buildings which I recently noticed among other things.

The gaming industry has gotten to a point where your game working is something that people should praise, since every other game especially AAA is broken and sometimes even unplayable. I remember playing Valhalla and it constantly crashing, even playing it a month or two ago before shadows came out it still crashed 1-2 times, which is astonishing. I also don't have a weak PC so that definitely isn't a reason. However, this game works flawlessly, I have had 0 crashes, random FPS drops or any other issues, so I can only applaud the devs.

If you are down to play assassin's creed, a game set in Japan or just generally a good game. This is definitely a must.

If you have played AC Mirage you will know what im talking about because this games story is basically a copy and paste of Mirage but with some of the worst (English) voice acting you will ever experience in a video game. The story consists of you going around the game world taking out targets one by one each with there own self contained stories. Once again if you have played Mirage you will know why this is so terrible as it leaves all the side characters and developments of each story contained within there respective regions to the point where every side character and ultimately side story is extremely forgettable and adds almost nothing to the overall narrative besides just another person you have to kill. The side content in this game is also the worst in the series besides maybe Valhalla. Gone are the days of side quests from games like Origins or Odyssey and instead the overwhelming majority of side content is just more assassinations targets. The overall gameplay is conflicting because the combat is worse than Odyssey, Valhalla and Origins but the stealth is very well done and the best the series has been in years maybe even ever. Graphics and overall world design are both very good just like every other AC game. Parkour is the best out of all the RPG creeds. Progression and loot systems work very similarly to that of Odyssey which I think has the best progression out of the RPG creeds.

It makes a huge difference in immersion, and suddenly the story-arcs also appears to be better in line with a japanese epic (Shogun comes to mind) with a natural pace rather than the brain expecting an english versioned fast action packed paced block buster - which is a mistake in expectations. 

2. Set the difficulty level to expert. There is a misalignment in difficulty levels, so 'expert' actually represents a completely normal experience, while 'normal' makes the game way too easy (e.g. boring).

- Little bit glitchy with parkour moves (sometimes happens)
- Little bit annoying with the horse movement in and around trees (auto turns and causes movement loops)

Finally, an AC game that actually requires skill and effort to get through enemy zones. Yasuke is a cool, historically accurate character—but his gameplay is extremely dry. Honestly, if you want to play as Yasuke, you're better off playing Ghost of Tsushima. What I really dislike about this game is the story. It’s like Ubisoft has been allergic to writing an engaging narrative ever since Unity. And I say this as a huge fan who 100%'d all the original AC games as a kid. This game had a $500 million budget, yet I feel like I could pay a high schooler $50 to write a more enthusiastic script. Sure, the world is complex, and connecting certain plot points is challenging—but the writing is so bad I had to put the game down halfway through, even though I initially planned to 100% it. Controversy aside, the game is objectively great overall. The environment design is a technical marvel, gameplay (as Noae) is fun and engaging, and the graphics are up there with Horizon Forbidden West. As I said, my only real gripe is the writing.

191279733,english,"Decent game, worth the price. 

Great combat and stealth mechanics. Ubisoft's games are clearly unmatched when it comes to stealth.
Great character animations. Really fluid and artful sword-handling and parkour techniques by the protagonists. Facial animations are also very good.
Excellent world and environment design, with a lot of efforts put into details.
Main story is not bad but not great either. The main characters' personalities and principles are not invested deeply enough. For example, they aim to eradicate corruption and restore peace but in a lot of instances, quests demand killing guards and soldiers. It goes against their agenda for peace.
The game could really use some more drama, like in TV shows. A lot of cutscenes/story events really have the potential but are not quite there yet. 
Side quests still lack depth. A good portion of quests are just ""Assassinate somebody"" or ""Kill 50 bandits"" without the context or the story of it. A lot of times players just have to murder people in cold blood for the sake of completion of the game, but have no real justification for doing so. A lot of assassination targets don't feel quite deserving of it. Therefore, the satisfaction from killing bad guys does not exist. This is a design that vastly undermines Naoe and Yasuke's ideals, forcing them to assassinate anybody that is a target of a quest giver, without a moral consideration of what is just or right. Assassin's Creed games have never been good at giving branched choices or difficult decisions. They have always been linear, but this time it's a shallow, senseless kind of linear. Tedious quests like ""Kill 25 outlaws"" are regularly given throughout the game; they are repetitive and meaningless, so much that I don't understand the point of completing them. I'm positive most players hate these, so I'm at a loss for a reason why the devs made them. 
The map is huge and contains numerous locations. However, these locations lack the depth and the events that make them interesting or unique. The castles and outposts are just there to raid. The towns/villages are just there as a map marker. There is no background, no interesting character, no story-related intrigues to explore in such locations around the world. Exploration therefore feels bland, boring and repetitive. 
Inappropriate music in some situations/cutscenes (Applying modern music in medieval times).

Combat 10/10
-You can play RPG Style or you can choose to play Old style with one hit assassinations. The ability to choose is absolute godsend, I hated the RPG style of the new AC series and preferred the old school style of just assassinating everything with one hit.

Graphics 10/10

Gameplay 8/10
-They did not stray far from the ""Assassins Creed"" mechanic which involves a lot of parkour and a lot of running, some people love this some people dont. AI can sometimes be clunky and some bugs need to be ironed out, but nothing game breaking.

Story/World 7/10
- While the story is not the best, it is still immersive and pretty good. World is just huge with lots of things to see and explore, I would actually say it has ""too many"".

Overall rating 9/10 - AC fans eating good after this release!! I was actually one of the skeptical ones because past AC games was Sh*t! but with this my faith has been slightly restored.

191274011,english,"I will preface this by saying that if you don't like the standard AC/Ubisoft Open World formula, this game isn't going to change your mind. It is very much that experience.

Oh, and yes, the Ubisoft Connect garbage is terrible and needs to not ever be a thing.


That said, I think this game is worth checking out, albeit on a relatively deep discount for most.

Elephant in the room, too, but there are micro transactions, though as far as I can tell, it's mostly, if not entirely cosmetics. There's probably also shortcut kits or currency stuff to avoid grinding, but the grinds for those aren't egregious to the point where I've even checked, at least as of 17 hours in focusing side questing.

Moving onto presentation, I think there's a lot to love here. The game looks really really good, and runs shockingly well. I do have some complaints, as facial animations in particular are pretty rough, but they're not terrible. Sound is... Iffy, the music choice went more for modern sounding hip-hop over more old school Japanese instruments/sounds, which is off-putting. The English Voice acting is also... Not the greatest. I'd recommend going for ""Immersive Mode"" to change voices to Japanese if it's that jarring, though I switched it off since the lip-syncing is for the English voices and I found I preferred having properly synced faces to better voiceovers.


In terms of gameplay, there's a lot to like here. Again, there's nothing groundbreaking, but I do like how they let you pick between the ""rah rah kill everyone and don't even attempt subtlety"" and the more standard stealthy assassin style of play. Both characters can fight direct or go stealthy, but they're both very heavily tuned for their preferred style. I went with normal difficulty for both stealth and fighting, I found that ticking the stealth difficulty up made the game kind of annoying, and I imagine some later missions aren't tuned around the additional detection (can't say for certain since I'm not straight lining the main story, though based on Black Flag being the last AC game I played, I'd imagine some missions getting really annoying with easier detection).

Overall, as someone who doesn't play as much AC as I probably honestly want to, it's a very good time and will likely get your money's worth. Although it's not groundbreaking at all.

Solid recommend, although unless you're really really into it (which you're probably not if you're reading reviews), I'd wait for a sale.",True,0,1,1743048809,76561198091944393,1626

191272884,english,"This is the most soul-draining Assassin’s Creed ever. Been waiting for the Japan setting forever and wow, can a game possibly get more repetitive and unenjoyable than this?

[h2] [b]Good:[/b][/h2] 
[list]
[*]It’s Japan. Japanese voice actors are great. Music is very nice.
[*]It’s graphically beautiful, the vegetation is especially well done. (playing on a 3080Ti)
[*]Temples are well recreated. Koyasan especially, it’s almost exactly like real life.
[*]Customizable hideout is something new and very cool.
[/list]

[h2] [b]Bad:[/b][/h2] 
[list]
[*]Scout system. Very annoying, such a waste of time.
[*]Horses are copy and paste from previous ACs. No effort was made.
[*]Story is terrible, insanely cliché. It’s excruciating to watch the cutscenes. Facial animations almost nonexistent. You play Yasuke for 10m and then Naoe for what feels like an eternity, enough time to forget that Yasuke is even in the game. Right after Naoe’s father dies, you get a flashback about her father, which completely takes you out of the vengeful emotion they were trying to convey. (also, it's kind of hilarious that the first thing you do is train for combat with him, when just minutes ago you were slashing entire armies).
[*]The Iga meditation flashbacks are such an excellent way to break immersion and fragment the story.
[*]Sync points are all in the most horrible, inconvenient locations possible. Not enough of them. It’s a waste of time.
[*]Parkour is bad, it’s like nothing is made for parkour. Magnetically follows the top of temples. Doesn’t flow well, it’s not enjoyable. Animations feel disconnected from one another. AC Unity felt superior. This is what I used to enjoy most about AC. What happened?
[*][I]“Only Yasuke can move this object”[/I]. Are you kidding me? Also Yasuke can’t climb castles? What kind of Assassin’s Creed is that? Being forced to switch characters to do certain things is stupid. Yet another waste of time. (As least this message reminded me that Yasuke was in the game.)
[*]RPG/level system. Completely hinders natural exploration, removes the fun, forces you to grind.
[*]Combat system, I don’t understand the praise. It’s actually very mid.
[*]Every mission so far has been extremely boring. Even the ones with “action” were not entertaining and poorly orchestrated.
[*]Exploration is painful, you can no longer cut through vegetation and you’re forced to follow extremely boring paths. You can no longer climb anything. Trying to cut through vegetation will often result in you getting stuck and having to reload the game, making you waste even more time. I guess it’s more realistic but not fun. Games are supposed to be fun. Even areas around some castles were poorly designed, you can get stuck and will need to reload.
[*]The world is pretty much dead. The towns feel dead. It’s very underwhelming. Very repetitive too, no sense of awe or discovery, it’s all the same, there is no surprise, no sense of interaction with anything.
[*]You can’t skip the night, are you kidding me? Half the game is spent barely seeing anything. You didn’t need to take “Shadows” so literally. Yes the nighttime looks good but it’s nowhere near as beautiful and vibrant as the daytime.
[*]Rain, wind and fog: Why is it always so rainy, foggy or windy? That’s legit infuriating. When it’s not night, you have a 5 minutes window to actually enjoy the environments before there’s another thunderstorm.
[*]Some parts of the game look like they were procedurally generated and others are straight up unfinished (there’s areas with terrain devoid of trees, just bare geometry). AAAA gaming I guess?
[*]Photomode is a downgrade from previous entries, at least on PC, the interface is slow and inconvenient to use.
[*]World map is slow and not properly reactive when zooming in/out and moving around on PC, both using the keyboard and the mouse.
[*]Clutter and microtransactions are back.
[*]No more bird to fly around. It would seem especially useful and nice to have in this AC, but it was deleted.
[*]Game crashes sometimes (apparently it’s been fixed).
[/list]

[h2] [b]Conclusion :[/b][/h2] 
What I thought would be a big tech upgrade and revival of the franchise ends up being an incredible letdown. Game had massive potential, even for DLCs with new prefectures/islands. But it’s already extremely repetitive and exploration is a pain. Gameplay/parkour isn’t fun. Everything seems made to waste your time. Atmosphere is off, and it’s hard to enjoy the environments due to the unskippable nights and exaggerated weather system. Some parts of the game feel unfinished. Story is abysmal. I seriously wish good luck to Ubisoft trying to sell another AC game to me ever again, and that’s coming from a Ubisoft sheep who bought every single Assassin’s Creed game.",False,0,0,1743047131,76561198067483851,393

191272187,english,"First off, the good.. naoe is beautiful. that's it. 

the bad. this game is a product of woke propaganda. that instead letting players be immersed in the world of japanese culture and become a samurai, they gave us an option to play a black dude, smashing gates as he is bigger than an oxen, ramming mid size japanese and beheading them. We just want to play as a japanese samurai, not some black dude, this is outrageous.

plus, ramming the doors by sprinting? have I mentioned that before? oh right, I had, goodness gracious. this is hilarious. Gates are usless for Yasuke as he is as big as an oxen. 

Controls are clunky. unlike other AC games controls, the automatic horseback riding to enjoy the view was also remove. the devs are giving us less and making us pay more. the QoL is wooooooorse!

I love Naoe, but I really like to play and role play as samurai, but can't do that without laughing and at the same time feeling cringe with this Yasuke fellla. Ghost of Tsushima is waaaaaay better than this crap, and that game is far older than this.

Storywise, it is bland, sooo bland it is boring, no depth, unlike Ghost of Tsushima, KCD2, and other RPG out there. every fewsteps are cutscenes that lacks power.

Plus this game is forcing to use Ray Tracing, i know others will say, get a better hardware, but not all gamers have that capability, out there there are majority of players who are have no way of playing games with Ray tracing on as they cant upgrade as of course some have other priorities. simple option to enable the players to turn it on or off was not included leaving players to force to play in lower fps. 

This game could have been the BEST AC game they ever released. but no, 
1. first is the character, Yasuke, a black dude, over tons of japanese characters you could've based on during that era? really? 
2. QoL are soooo bad, forcing players to do more work, and play in their most inconveniece.
3. Story is bland, animations are repeatitive. 
4. Controls are clunky
5. Ubisoft connect on a singleplayer game. plus anti cheat. this shows that the developers DOESNT CARE for  their consumers. they don't care what will make the gamers life convenient as long as they can provide crap that we will pay for.
6. you can't skip time!! you actually have to wait til night comes. and not everyone has the time to do that. some people only have an hour or two to play this game, and waiting 24min real time is just a waste of time. 
7. UBISOFT has a way of forcing their ideology and practices to their consumers without giving them options to choose how they want to play their game. this is just trash.  UBISOFT please check how Warhorse made KCD2 and learn from them. you guys should learn from them.

I am just bummed that I played long enough for me to unable to refund this rubbish. but I want to see it through so I could give a proper feedback. and trust me, I tried to like this game in extent of buying it, did not even refund this so I could provide as honest feedback as I could give. for people saying this is a good game, they are total liars. they lie. and the Very Positive reviews are fake for sure, and it is most likely a very positive ones as people who doesn't support this crap of a game didn't buy it. so there will be no people to not recommend it. but even so, you can see lots of people who bout not recommending this game. Like I said, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME PLEASE IT IS A TRAAAAP.

It is probably largest open world title I have ever seen, but it's definitely the emptiest. You will not find anything if you go off the path, the game is about going to pings on the map, and finding out which activity is there (except the wildlife paintings which are randomly encountered). There are no puzzles, unique challenges or mechanics to explore. Levelling up felt more like a punishment instead of a reward, because the enemies get stronger with you. Part of the problem, is that you have to level up your gear with resources which after a certain point you have to grind for, since the upgrade cost gets pricier every time. If you don't do that, the enemies will be stronger while you stay the same and just straight up feel weaker. After unlocking the second playable character, it even get's worse because now you need to manage another set of gear. Yasuke would be a greater addition if switching characters was smoother, or it wasn't forced on the player to use him. The story is not bad, but gets cringey at parts and is quite predictable.

It is best if you make your own opinion by watching some walk through (any youtuber is fine) but remember!! make your own opinion regardless of what the youtuber says.

I have more than 20 hours and only starting Act 2. I tried to review the good and bad ones from my game time and there's a couple of things that I need to say

[h3] Micro transaction [/h3]
It's actually a game progression level where you do some weekly challenges, level it up and collect the rewards. ohh and its a one time only. So far, the game never slap those things while I play the game and I sometimes forgot that they exist

[h3] Denuvo [/h3]
Surprisingly, it runs well like REALLY WELL for a DRM game. Never had a stutter or anything. But hey, if you still dont like DRM in this game, its fine. Everybody has different taste.

[h3] The weather and season change your playstyle completely [/h3]
Ermm yeah its a yes and no. If you play like a normal person would, you are just gonna do the old hide, assassinate and what not just like the previous game. The season only add flavour and some miniscules advantage and disadvantage on your approach. The only thing that change our playstyle is when we play whether as Naoe or Yasuke. Other than that, I just do the same thing pillaging some castle.

191268362,english,"As much as I would have loved to watch Ubisoft take another L, I can't deny that this is probably the best AC game that's come out in years. Apparently it took facing the very real possibility of bankruptcy for this circus of a company to get its act together. 

But just look at the results! 90% of the Origins RPG nonsense has been removed. There's no more stupid ""Time Savers"" for you to purchase. Assassinations actually kill the target again, with just a few exceptions to keep the game interesting. The brainless modern age narrative has been reduced to a 2 minute cutscene at the beginning of the game. There is, unfortunately, a battlepass (old habits die hard I guess) but it's free and almost completely irrelevant to to actual game.

And now, finally, with all the old baggage burned, AC is allowed to focus on its one shining truth: 
Breaking into castles and stabbing people is fun.

The stealth is stylish and interactive while the combat (which I initially thought looked like shit in the trailers) feels amazing to play and is a blast to pull off. With the core stabbing gameplay well and truly nailed, Ubisoft has set about making a gigantic map absolutely PACKED with huge Japanese castles for you to tackle.

And for as much hate as it got, I personally think that the dual protagonist plan was a brilliant move. Ubisoft had two groups of fans to please: the meathead tourists that wanted a gorefest power fantasy (Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla), and the snobby purists that wanted a classic AC game (Brotherhood, Revelations, Black Flag). Splitting the protagonist into two very different, popular styles (ninja or samurai) and letting the player pick their poison was a great way to make sure that everyone gets what they want and that the game stays on theme.

But even with all that praise, Ubisoft needed a smash hit to save their brand and I just don't think that this game will cut it. It's still got just about everything that makes the AC games suck: 
  · Lots of boring travel time bouncing back and forth between uninteresting objectives before you can even THINK about stabbing someone  
  · WAY too many characters for literally any of them to be memorable (even the leads are pretty dry)
  · Mountains of dialogue that you will inevitably start skipping (slippery slope)
  · Genuine historical information and research that is absolutely wasted on the audience of these games (pls just let us stab someone)

I somehow managed to get a lot of fun out of Shadows, despite its flaws. Like I said before, this is the best Assassin's Creed game that's come out in years. But unfortunately for Ubisoft, it's still Assassin's Creed.

191262690,english,"Let me preface this review with:
All the rage bait, controversies, hating, etc., on social media, I never really followed. There's certainly some validity there for some things, but for the most it seems very much overblown. Do I think Ubisoft could do better? Yes, absolutely. Do I hate Ubisoft Connect? Yup, but it's not the worst thing in the world and I've been using it for a lot of other older AC games in the past. It's worked and I honestly don't mind it because, well, I'm usually playing this game connected to a desktop PC with an active internet connection.

Now, for the actual game itself, which is what this review is really about.

First off, the English voice acting is...well, it could honestly be A LOT better. Nothing against the voice actors, but in a game set in Japan, it just feels so off. Luckily, you can change the voice acting to Japanese and it is SO much better, and provides a little more realistic immersion into the game.

Second, the story. Well, so far, it's basically kill bill but in Japan. Again, not bad, but it's not as riveting as, say, your first time with Ezio in AC:2. Then again, it's still kind of a revenge story so...take it for what you will. It's serviceable but nothing mind-blowing.

Third, the music. It's fine. Again, serviceable, but certainly the soundtracks seem a little...not appropriate for the time setting I guess? It's not bad. For me, it's not overly distracting.

Now, finally, we get to the big meat-and-potatoes: The Gameplay.
Honestly, I'm having a TON of fun with it. If you've played Odyssey or Origins, chances are, like me, you found that there was almost TOO much to do, and the RPG mechanics were too much in your face and ugh, it just didn't FEEL like AC. Sure, they tried to reinvent it, but maybe they went a bit far with that.
AC: Shadows does kind of a blend between systems you saw in Odyssey and Origins and blends it with, probably I would say Black Flag in a way. Parkour is simpler, RPG mechanics make sense, the combat mechanics are servicable and actually engaging because you can't just spam attacks, though, you could and make an ass-assin (heh) of yourself. For the true purists, you can even turn ON Guaranteed Assassinations which...I feel would make the game too easy. Without it on, heavy enemies with heavy armor and weapons actually can't be assassinated from the get-go because, well, turns out blade can't pierce heavy armor that well. Whoulda thunk? So, the game actually blends that all pretty well in my opinion.
There's plenty of collectables and lore about Japan and the story to be found throughout the game and I'm enjoying actually getting to explore Japan.

There's even tiny little attention to details such as when Naoe steps inside a building, her shoes come off (though there's no animation, but that makes sense for a sense of flow), or not being able to harm animals and not climbing on Torii gates.
All-in-all, they did a really great job with portraying Japan in the 1500s and I'm really pretty ecstatic about the attention to detail they gave the game to give you an authentic feel for how Japan would have been like in those days.
Yasuke not included.

So, in conclusion, if you still have mad hate for Ubisoft, you're not going to like this game or Ubisoft any better because let's face it, you're already on the rage-bait cult that has become the internet as of late, and that's probably not going to change unless you go touch some grass and learn to form an opinion of your own.
If, however, you can appreciate a game made by thousands of dedicated designers, developers, actors, etc., and can appreciate that yes, there are some flaws with this game, and yes Ubisoft could stand to do a hell of a lot better as a company, but you can look at this game independently and understand the hard work and dedication that went into making this game a reality and not a shite-fest like a lot of people expected, you will probably like this game. Fans of older and maybe some newer AC games will find enjoyment here. If you're a diehard fan, maybe look elsewhere.

I give this game, a 4/5. Play it, finish it. If you're not dying to play it, wait for it to go on sale.",True,0,0,1743033565,76561197999646251,2900

191262402,english,"So far, I highly recommend Assassin's Creed: Shadows! It is actually a lot of fun, more than you'd think with all the negativity surrounding it. Of the four RPG AC games, I would have to say, this is my second favorite one. I think it is better than both Origins and Valhalla, but I do still like Odyssey a little more. 

Now, onto the game itself. Firstly, the setting is magnificent. I am actually speechless with how beautiful the world is, and how actually fun to explore it is! I am always getting sidetracked, and not even by gameplay events, but literally just by walking around and enjoying the world. Then you have the combat. This is by far my favorite AC combat system, it improves on Valhalla's great combat, making it less floaty. Very brutal as well. 

Now, I'll tie the stealth into the characters, as it differs for each one. On one hand, you have Naoe. She is a Shinobi, the true assassin. I really love playing as her. The stealth in this game, when using Naoe, is great! Stalking from the roofs, or bushes, taking down enemies one at a time, etc etc. It rocks! Parkour is just meh, same as the other RPG games. I will say, it is an improvement, but mostly just in the animations available. Otherwise the older AC games are still better in that regard. Then there is Yasuke. He sucks at stealth, and parkour. Obviously that is not his purpose. He is a tank, and my god he is good at being THE tank. He feels like Eivor. Since it is AC, I do prefer Naoe, but Yasuke isn't bad by any means, just not my style of play.

The story is also pretty good. I really like their choice of music, it is much different than normal, and I think the Flight did a wonderful job this time around! The writing is pretty strong with the main quests, as well as the smaller side quests as Naoe, when you revisit Iga. Typical quests though, taking down the big bad order. 

Downsides, well, there's a couple. Few bugs where proper enemies don't spawn in castles, can't complete them. Facial animations aren't the greatest, could be better. This is mainly a nitpick, I don't think it should effect your opinion on the game as it is optional, but paid cosmetics just seem off... just let us get them via hard quests or something. It is a singleplayer game, not a mp one. Those were my main issues, honestly not bad at all for a new release.

191261401,english,"Great game if you're itching for that Assassin's Creed experience. Don't listen to the anti-woke, gamer rage rhetoric that seems to be spreading to more and more games these days.

It's not to say this is a perfect game, there's no such thing. I dislike the map layout and some of the ""invisible walls"" that make getting from point A to point B a drag. The game also starts out slow with a lot of dialogue and a lot of flashback stuff, but I'm a Kojima fan, so it's nothing I can't handle.

I will say I like the differences in playstyle between the two characters. You can choose to go the classic stealth route or take on a more head-on approach that is more similar to Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Ragnarok. You also often get a choice to spare or kill your enemies, which I'm hoping has some story payoffs later on, but we will see.

Music is cool. They mix in some modern Japanese rock in some points of the story which I think is a nice addition. The voice acting isn't necessarily the best, but it also makes me wonder if some of those choices were deliberate?

The seasons and weather change throughout the game, which is a nice touch. There are also some differences in the world depending on where you go, which is nice as well. You get some beautiful nature, but also some war torn areas that gave me a very ""Princess Mononoke"" vibe.

The differences in weapons is fun to experiment with a well. It's nice to see it's not only katanas and hidden blade stuff.

Overall, good game. I also understand some people hesitating because of the price, which I totally understand. I think that's an industry issue rather than just an Assassin's Creed or Ubisoft issue, though. If you feel that strongly about it, put this sucker on your wishlist and wait for a sale, just like every other game out there.

The game has an system with inventory items that provide various bonuses. I had worries that the bonuses and rarity of such items would give the stink of a live service. I was worried about the system just getting in the way playing the game. It is a set and forget system that slips into the background. It is a non-issue. The live service elements from the previous games are not getting in the way.

Pro: The athmosphere and Landscapes are beautifull and playing Naoe you get these assasin vibes.

Con: Super grindy, controlls are somwhat clunky, You have to follow the way since moste mountainsides are almost unclimbable, The map is heavily overloaded with loot and bandits, combat is repetitive at best (sometimes downright borring and anoying since the controlls are not too responsive), NPCs have little to non daily routine and appear somewhat plastic, and the storry so far is a hard meh.

It is slightly better than AC Valhalla but a far cry from the really good ACs like 2, Brotherhood and Blackflag.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a 9/11-level disaster—not in real-world weight, obviously, but in the way it spectacularly crashes and burns what should’ve been a dream game. Ubisoft was handed feudal Japan on a silver platter, a setting fans have begged for since forever—and they still managed to botch it like it was an experimental beta.

The opening sequence teases something emotional, something epic… then dies a slow death thanks to writing so bland it could be AI-generated, and voice acting that makes Siri sound like Shakespeare. Naoe, our stealthy cardboard cutout of a protagonist, delivers her lines like she’s just learned human speech. Combine that with a face that has the emotional range of wet tofu, and you’ve got yourself an “assassin” less compelling than your average background NPC. Seriously, even peasants grunting about rice sound more invested.

Combat? Hope you enjoy déjà vu. It’s the same few katana animations repeated like a YouTube loop glitch. After the 40th slash, it’s less ""samurai fantasy"" and more ""unpaid intern doing motion capture on repeat.""

The environment looks stunning—until you step into the woods and realize you’ve entered nature’s version of a maze with no exit. Beautiful, yes. Playable? Only if you enjoy hiking into frustration.

And then there's Yasuke. A historically intriguing figure reduced to... a checkbox. Ubisoft clearly wanted to make a point, but instead of writing him with depth, they just gave him a sword and hoped no one would ask questions. It’s less representation and more glorified background noise with a hitbox.

Enemy AI? Hilariously broken. Try stealth-killing a guy who's napping, and he’ll casually stand up halfway through your assassination like he's just remembered he left the stove on. You basically have to kill some enemies *three times* just to convince them it’s bedtime.

Still playing though. Why? Because I can pet animals and slice bamboo. Which, at this point, offers more satisfaction than the actual plot. Assassin’s Creed Shadows feels like a beautiful mess—you’ll cringe, you’ll laugh, but somehow you’ll still be having a good time.",True,0,3,1743028826,76561198844598246,1987

191257270,english,"Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an incredible experience that fans of a game set in Japan needed. The open world is absolutely stunning, with vast cities and huge castles that bring feudal Japan to life in a way that the video game industry rarely does (even games like Ghost of Tsushima or Rise of the Ronin, although they're wonderful, don't have the architectural beauty and immersion that Shadows brought to us). The gameplay is cool, the story blends history and fiction together nicely and the world-building immerses you in all the cultural details that I wasn't expecting and it was a surprise. However, the overly steep mountains of the map can seem inaccessible, occasionally breaking the flow of exploration, the world could be more '-flat', even if it does cost a bit of realism. 

On the other hand, it's disappointing to see the unjustified hate this game has faced.It's a shame that such trivial excuses mask the prejudice of certain people, overshadowing a game that deserves to be praised for its bold choices and quality. Saying that the Japanese hate the game is erroneous because it's only a few right-wing minorities who are doing so. Many are criticizing the game for things that other games have already done before, but no one complained about, just because of their biases, and that's not right, it's called a double standard. 

No one is going to destroy temples in Japan because of Shadows, this was the same ignorant speech that our parents and grandparents said in 2005 when we used to play GTA, assuming that it would make us violent, anyone who was a gamer in the 2000s knows what I'm talking about.

Give it the necessary criticism, but in a constructive way. For me it's a 9/10 and I thank the developers for their hard work and may they continue to expand the world of Shadows with new content and new regions to explore.

Thank you for creating the game that the 12-year-old me dreamed of while playing Tenchu or ShinobiDo in PS2, it's like seeing a dream come true.",True,0,0,1743027279,76561198317922990,3553

However, I decided to buy AC: Shadows as my way of saying ""thank you"" to Ubisoft for original games (AC1, AC2, BHD, RVL etc.). If here is any chance and time to ""help"" Ubisoft for what they gave us years ago, it's now.  I played for like 15 hours right now and... I am having fun, sort of.

What is unclear for me right from the start? First 2 hours of the game are like really, really long cutscene. It's great that devs wanted to create backstory for new characters, but it's just long, long, long. I actually have a theaory that prologue is so long, so players can not return this game on Steam (there is a limit, right? 2 hours within 14 days, I guess?). I think that was the main reason they did this so long, not will to create good story, since after 2 hours there are less cutscens. That's not fair.

Game is fun, characters are likeable, but I am getting annoyed with looking for characters that hide in diffrent places, without any concrete hints (east side of XY, that's not even a hint since you need to go into all houses to find that one specific NPC xd) - it is annoying after a while.

I will consider it 7/10 for now, I will update this review when I will complete the game, or find something that will drive me crazy.

A Masterpiece of Stealth and Combat in Feudal Japan

Assassin’s Creed Shadows brings the long-awaited journey to feudal Japan, and Ubisoft has absolutely nailed it. The game offers an immersive open-world experience, blending stunning visuals, fluid combat, and deep storytelling.

🔥 Pros:
✔ Two Playable Characters – Switch between Naoe, the deadly shinobi, and Yasuke, the unstoppable samurai, each with unique abilities and playstyles.
✔ Breathtaking World – Feudal Japan has never looked better, from neon-lit towns to peaceful temples. The attention to detail is insane.
✔ Stealth & Combat Balance – Whether you prefer sneaky assassinations or full-on sword fights, the game delivers both flawlessly.
✔ Engaging Storyline – A gripping narrative filled with historical figures, betrayals, and epic battles.
✔ Customization & Progression – Tons of weapons, armor, and skills to unlock and adapt your gameplay.

⚡ Cons:
✖ Occasional performance drops on PC (though patches are improving it).
✖ Some RPG elements feel a bit unnecessary.

Overall, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of the best entries in the franchise, bringing the long-awaited ninja and samurai fantasy to life. A must-play for AC fans and newcomers alike!

191248216,english,"Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a pretty solid entry in the franchise, best thing Ubisoft has put out in a while. It actually feels like they put effort into the world-building, and the feudal Japan setting is absolutely gorgeous, with insane attention to detail. The dual protagonists are a cool touch—Naoe’s stealth gameplay is the best the series has seen in years, and Yasuke brings a fun, weighty combat style that mixes things up. Sure, it’s still got some of Ubisoft’s usual open-world bloat, but at least the missions feel more engaging than the usual ""checklist"" formula they’ve been stuck on. Overall, it’s not perfect, but compared to Star Wars Outlaws, Valhalla, Mirage, Skull and Bones. I can see that they actually put effort and this one actually feels fresh and worth playing—a solid 7.5 or 8/10.  

Pros:

✅ Beautiful open world with tons to explore
✅ Smooth and satisfying combat
✅ Stealth gameplay is really well done
✅ Playing as two different characters adds variety
✅ Engaging story with cool historical elements
✅ More fluid and realistic parkour compared to previous games.
✅Dynamic weather affects gameplay/Four seasons cycle throughout the game

Cons:
❌ Some missions feel repetitive
❌ A few minor performance issues here and there

If you liked the other RPG AC games or Ghosts of Tsushima you will likely enjoy this, plenty of content, very pretty looking and improves over previous titles in a few ways, most noticeably stealth. On the highest difficulty they actually have working eyes, rather good ones in fact. They still don't have ears but I'll take the improvement.

Along with playing on the hardest difficulty (at least for stealth) I also recommend turning off most* of the HUD elements (it's all customisable) for a much more immersive experience.

Nothing hugely groundbreaking though, if you hate the Ubisoft formula for open world games I don't think this will change your mind.

My biggest gripe with the game is actually the facial animations.. They're comically bad, lip sync and just everything about them, I really don't understand why Ubisoft seem to be years behind on this front compared to other games considering everything else looks really good.

Clearing out camps stealthily and marking them off on the map is pretty much the reason i bought this game and its fine. 

I dont think Yasuke is fun to play and much of the map isnt designed for him to traverse anyway. This game would be great if you could just stick to one character the entire time.

Many if not all quests require you to play as one of them specifically, which is annoying on an immersion level, but also adds to the already frustrating amount and length of loading screens.

this is a slop game and im here for some slop so the skill trees are uh just ok i guess. you earn ability points really quickly but idk i dont really fw any of the upgrades. 

I also like ac games to passively learn a lil watered down semi-accurate history, and this is good. idrk any medieval japanese history but i looked up some names and i like that this game does stuff similarly to ac odyssey.

the story is ok but if youre even considering that in your purchase decision you dont really know what youre getting yourself into.

Not sure what I expected. But if you've played any AC game from the past 10 years or so, you've played this one. After about 15 hours I realized the rest of the game would be identical. It's the same bland, tired and uninspired combat they've all had. 

This game seems somehow more grindy than the other recent releases. I assume by design, to have you spend money on their pathetic online store. I don't think a company exists that cares less for its customers than Ubisoft. Just disrespectful. Oh you want that sweet new sword? Can't earn that in game. You must spend money on top of the $70 you already spent to have the coolest gear. 

And no matter how much grind you put in to this bloated bland fest, the gameplay is the same. They spent a good amount building out the world with detail and it looks nice, but you don't get to learn the territory and appreciate it that much considering you just tag a waypoint and it'll draw a line on screen to follow. The game is made for turning your brain off and cycling the same button presses over and over and over again. 

The dialog? Yikes. Like most of these modern AAA releases, it seems like it was written by someone who's never had a significant relationship in their life. No one talks like this. No one. Except maybe in the overly PC world of corporate America. It's alarming how awful the writing is in modern AAA games. If writing was my profession, I would be embarrassed to have my name in the credits of these games. 

So after 20+ hours of this game, all it made me do is reinstall Ghosts of Tsushima. A massively better game in all aspects. So for those that want a samauri / japanese setting, do yourself a favor and go pickup the better option.",False,0,2,1743011233,76561197960448228,1612

But being a Ubisoft title it comes with its caveat. Currently right now this game is unplayable for my system (mind you my system is not outdated whatsoever). I am currently facing issues where quest are broken, when speaking to NPC to continue a quest-line the game freezes and doesn't action the cut scene.

Another bug is loading into the map, sometimes it is so slow and takes a good solid minute (game is installed on a SSD). Other times the map goes black or flickers trying to give me a late night rave when all I want to do is check the map. The game would of been good if these bugs have been fleshed out or sold at lower price.

On one hand, the game brings a fresh take on the series with refined stealth mechanics and smoother parkour, making the gameplay feel more immersive. The dark, atmospheric world and the new protagonist's story are intriguing, and the combat is fluid and satisfying at first. However, the game also struggles with some pacing issues; certain sections feel unnecessarily slow, and the lack of depth in the protagonist’s backstory leaves you feeling detached. The combat, while smooth, starts to feel repetitive after a while, and the open-world exploration can feel aimless, with too many filler objectives that don’t add much to the overall experience. While it’s an enjoyable game for Assassin’s Creed fans, it doesn’t quite live up to the excitement and polish that we’ve come to expect from the series.

Gameplay is solid, with one major issue: enemy AI is terrible. Other than that, no real complaints.

Weapon variety and designs are great, definitely one of the game’s strong points.

Having two characters with different gameplay styles really helped keep things fresh and engaging.

Parkour isn’t as amazing as it was hyped up to be, but it’s not bad either. Sometimes gets stuck in weird spots, which I hope gets fixed, but aside from that, it’s decent.

Stealth mechanics? Outstanding. One of the best stealth systems I’ve ever seen.

World design is a masterpiece especially with seasonal changes, which absolutely blew me away.

ALL the choices lead to the EXACT SAME outcome.  Given the option to kill or spare a character?  Choose the spare option... and my character still kills them.

The combat is a button mash fest.  Upgrading gear is a super grind - just like Odyssey.  Looting castles is extremely repetitive - kill the samurai, loot the chest, rinse and repeat for the entire game.  Most of the side quests are boring fetch and kill quests with no interesting story hook (BIG DOWNGRADE from things like the Delian League in Odyssey).  

The writing in the game is terrible.  The English voice acting is bad.  The game is full of bugs and glitches.  Tons of missing QOL features - for instance you can change the season, but you CAN'T change the time of day.  Your character no longer has a torch so when the game gets dark you can't see anything.  Modern day plot is non-existent.  There's pretty much no content tied into the Isu.  The quest log UI is a complete mess.  The open world activities are just one button presses and QTEs.

- Story -
Story is an improvement over the last few games and some older games like AC Unity and Syndicate, but I think it's still not as good as the older games. Two big factors is the cutscene quality and voice acting. Sometimes there's pretty good cutscenes and sometimes there's just cutscenes that look straight outta Walking Dead Season 1
English Voice acting is pretty bad for most characters like Naoe where it feels like they just told an AI to read off a script. Other languages are fine tho
The overall narrative is alright, some of the characters feel kinda underdeveloped and uninteresting, but most of the cast is okay. One thing I did not expect is preferring Yasuke's story more than Naoe's, for reasons I dont really wanna say cause spoilers. I'm a bit confused on why there's nothing about the Isu in this tho, bit disappointing

- Gameplay -
The combat is way better than the other RPG games, with enemies being more aggressive and actually being a little bit diffcult now.
Stealth is way better than all the other RPG games with more depth and mechanics to it, but the lack of social stealth leaves me longing for a bit more. AI is weird tho, sometimes you can get spotted on a roof pretty easily, and sometimes you can just stand in front of an enemy and they wont do anything. Basically it's inconsistent
Exploration is mid, mostly the same as the other games but with more activities
Movement feels way better (even with Yasuke) but parkour basically has no depth cause the environment isn't built for it lol

191229392,english,"[h1] Looks good and feels good. BUT, it's just more of the same again. [/h1]

This means:
- locations seem vibrant and full of life at first but are devoid of any meaningful content, and are recycled all the time
- side quests are inconsequential and mostly boring
- low-rarity gear becomes irrelevant almost immediately if you actually commit to exploration. loot is only good for currency or upgrade mats. you don't expect to find anything good when clearing an outpost
- very limited assortment of available armors which reduces customization options. you can buy *cooler* sets in the mtx store but they actually look like shit anyway lmao
- main story is bland which is not a huge issue, but It has some [b] MAJOR [/b] cornball moments

Despite that, the gameplay and visuals carry the experience. 
It's fun to clear the copypasted castles even if they feel like doing the same activity again and again. 

I've been enjoying [b] Naoe's [/b] playstyle: she's swift, sticks to the shadows, and actually gets to do dramatic flips and assassinate people. She's actually good at combat too! It's a bit more challenging than with her samurai counterpart but she gets the job done, and she has some sweet anims too! If you invest a few perks into weapon trees you can actually make it easier and cheese through your enemies no problem, if that's what you prefer.
[b] Yasuke [/b] is not for me, which fucking sucks because I lock myself out of a lot of content by choosing not to play him as much. He's big. He's burly. A bull in a china shop if you will. He just doesn't meet my expectations. He makes combat so laughably easy that you can ram into the enemies and start relentlessly hacking away without minding your HP bar. I guess that could be fun for some people, however I would have preferred it if they just made one character with the ability to go full Rambo OR assassin. It would definitely make the gameplay more seamless and help with the customization issue.

This two protagonists conundrum isn't really as bad as people make it out to be though, you can switch characters on the fly so if there is a spot that your current character can't get to then you just get to hold a button and sit through a quick loading screen. You can just pick the one that matches your style and then help yourself with the other character whenever you need to. Game very visibly favors Naoe though, and if you want to play as Yasuke you'll have to speed through a few hours of the main story before you unlock him. Sorry I guess lmao

Overall, all the issues it has are the same ones that were prevalent in the previous ""modern"" installments. If that doesn't put you off and you like the general gameplay loop just get it, there's a lot of hours that you can spend on it and it is just mindless fun. And if you're uncomfortable with gay stuff or are afraid of black people then you don't have to engage with that content! Amazing, huh? Enjoy the game, it's pretty as fuck!

191229261,english,"This is an edit to my previous review after playing a while longer. 

At first glance, the open world seems bland. However, I suggest slowing down and paying more attention to the details. For instance I went to a temple where people were hanging out. Out of no where people started running and I thought it was my character due to poor or buggy game design. However, I noticed some bandits chasing some villagers. I killed two.

 The game world is actually changing with the weather (seasons) and it really does look good. Its a pretty game. Although you can't really interact with the wild animals aside from drawing them (side activity), the world still feels immersive and alive at times. 

Overall, the more I play this game the more I enjoy it. I love Ghost of Tsuhima. Honestly there are things about both worlds you could say that are better, but I have to hand it to Ubisoft. I think they did a better job on world design. 

At first I was a little annoyed about the forced dsync on civilian kill (forced save reload). However, you can actually kill the civilians of other faction controlled areas. Castle areas for instance. If you don't, they run and tell the authorities if you are spotted. 

Give this game a shot. Play it and let it soak in. I think this is a game with some bland parts to it, but there are plenty of details in it that show off the beauty of its open world if one is willing to slow down and pay attention. 

To Ubisoft: A future patch just for immersion would be nice. Maybe fishing mechanics, a garden for your hideout, or hunting and skinning. Even if its just for mon (in game currency). Also, the ability to eat and drink would be cool. 

You guys did a good job. However, some small tweaks could make this world even more immersive. Also, please fix the subtitles for random dialog between NPCs when playing on immersive mode.

191228893,english,"Before I review this game, I want to share my perspective on the AC franchise over the past few years.  

Now, look—I haven’t been invested in the AC universe since Syndicate came out, which I never finished. I bought Origins and Odyssey during a sale, but I only accumulated around 80 minutes of playtime in total. Valhalla? I skipped it entirely. While each of these games is vastly different from one another, they all bored me, and my faith in Ubisoft delivering anything consumer-oriented—and therefore enjoyable—was basically nonexistent. Honestly, I wanted this game to fail. I hoped it would be the final straw that forced Ubisoft to change things.  

On to the game itself: In short—I’m having an absolute blast playing this game.  

The prologue, while lengthy and almost entirely made up of cutscenes, does a great job of introducing the protagonists and their story. That said, it feels more like watching a movie than playing a game, so I’d recommend starting it when you have time to spare.  

The gameplay and combat system keep me constantly wanting to explore and improve my characters. Specifically, the stealth combat is okay—not the best, but decent. However, if you get spotted, I have to say I’m actually happy that it’s more challenging. Compared to Black Flag—my favorite AC game—where it really doesn’t matter if you’re up against 5, 50, or 500 enemies because counters always get you out of trouble, this game actually makes you think about how / if you engage in fights. While Challenging, its still Fun.

The game world and graphics are stunning. The visual beauty alone makes me want to explore and take my time doing so. I don’t think I’ve ever spent this much time in photo mode in any other game.  

One thing that still irritates me is the night-and-day stealth mechanic. The game makes a difference between attacking during the day and night, but it doesn’t let the player manually skip time to take advantage of nighttime stealth. I assume this has something to do with the changing seasons system, but wouldn’t it be better to simply not let time-skipping affect seasonal progression?  

This is the first story-driven game since Cyberpunk 2077 that keeps me thinking about it after I’ve stopped playing. I eagerly wait to get off work just to jump back in.  

The shop system and ""battle pass"" are fine as long as they don’t aggressively push me to spend money. So far, in my experience, they haven’t.  

In my opinion, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a step in the right direction. If you’re considering buying this game, I’d recommend waiting for a discount. Just because €70 is the new ""standard"" for games like this doesn’t mean it’s justified, in my opinion. That being said, if you have the money to spare and are looking to sink time into a well-crafted open world, go for it—I certainly did, and I don’t regret it.  

I felt obligated to write this review because I have a feeling many people share the same doubts I had. If you made it this far, I truly appreciate the time you took to read this.  

This review is probably longer than any essay I ever wrote in school.

I haven't played as Yasuke yet and im almost 20 hours into it level 17 on console, I played 3 hours or on PC and then moved to Playstation 5 thanks to the cross progression Ubisoft offers which is fantastic i can play it wherever I want everytime. I really enjoy everything that comes with the hideout, customization and also your allies and scouts which can help you find targets in the world. If you want to assassinate people without the level scaling then id turn on assassination gurantee in the options, I haven't yet because its not been a problem but I have in older games where level scaling wasn't as good as this. Never seen a rich world so alive in an Assassins Creed game since maybe AC3 I love Japan and I love the culture and history so this is honestly a 10/10 game for me.

As a casual fan of Assassins Creed, this is one of the best entries in years. I’ve played them all, my last favourite being Black Flag. I found odyssey and Valhalla way too overwhelming.

The juxtaposition of 2 very different characters keeps the game fresh. Combat feels really satisfying as Yasuke  and the stealth elements as Naoe are scratching a Splinter Cell itch for me. Being able to switch between the 2 almost on the fly is awesome. You can just brute force your way through, or stealth. And the trade offs between each character feel meaningful. 

As for the story, it exists. A classic revenge story. It’s not fantastic but I’m interested to see the characters develop. 

Assassins creed has never been about historical accuracy for me. It’s about putting me in a period of time in our history and letting me have fun. 

Which I’m definitely having with this game.

Oh, and the OST is phenomenal. 

The only downside I have for the game right now is some parkour can be a bit iffy. Usually in tight enclosed interiors, the hose controls can be annoying at times, and the microtransactions. There are microtransactions for gear and weapons.

Solid 30fps on steam deck also for on the go gaming! Awesome.

If Ubisoft reduced games it had created each year, focused on quality like what it has done to Shadows;
If Ubisoft didn’t insist to leave Steam and gave players the choice of gaming on their preferred platforms;
Ubisoft would not end up with the situation it is today. 

If Ubisoft didn’t try to ‘teach’ its audiences ‘history’, misleading players to believe AC represents history itself. Instead, make it steel clear that none of stuff the company has created has anything to do with the real world and shouldn’t be linked to each other. They’re fictional, nothing’s real. All these ‘arguments’ against Shadows would not spread like a wild fire in its community. In exchange, Ubisoft would not end up in the eye of an argumentative storm, the negative impact and damage to Shadows would have been reduced to minimum. 

Ubisoft has done glorious past for AC games, it proves it can recreate a similar glory as long as it about to bankrupt. Funny to say it, extreme condition creates miracle. Another typical example showed the best way to counter an anti-consumer company is to cut off your financial support. When it walks on the thin ice of destruction, it automatically comes back begging for your forgiveness. Make it struggle to survive is the only way to make it start caring about your demands as a customer. 

Anyways, putting all past matters aside, Shadows is a great game, there’s no mistaking it. Ubisoft really did everything it could this time, there’s little thing inside the game that I can pick up against it: everything’s enjoyable, from the story to the gameplay, combat, missions, puzzles, hideout building etc. All are addictive and fun. 
It’s a giant game, from the scale I’ve seen so far, easily 100h+. On the first day of its launch, I’ve played 14h straight away, hardly had any stop. This broke the longest record I’ve spent time in a game on the day of its arrival.

Every frame is a work of art, and the landscapes, from the mysterious temples to the lush forests, are simply spectacular.

Whether you prefer direct action or stealth infiltration, the game adapts to your style. The fights are intense and satisfying, and the progression system allows you to customize your character to your liking.
The music is another strong point, contributing to creating an epic and emotional atmosphere. The ambient sounds immerse you in the game's world, and the sound effects are realistic and immersive.

Pro's
It has amazing graphics

a wonderful story 

a huge map theres so much exploration it is very nice to see in any game.

the combat is great while i struggle with parts of it that is also just because im bad and forget camera lock exist. They did really well with the assassination parts of it and the parkour to me its a throw back to older AC games

they also have seasons and that is rare to see in any game where seasons change and you can see the change on the game as in snow melting  

theres alot more to talk about for it just note its a great game and while i was against the $70 price i decided to try it and it was 100% worth it.

Now the con's 

microtransactions its a single player game now if your uber lazy or want some fancy colors on your gear go right on ahead but i see no point in microtransactions in a single player game but thats been in AC for a long while. Its also in every single multiplayer game to come out in years so thats just part of life now.  

Knowledge points are annoying its alot of farming just to unlock abilities so if you dont feel like grinding you can easily cheat past that to then use your mastery points to unlock abilities skipping alot of the grind for it.   Now i wouldnt recommend skipping out on going to knowledge point locations as theres alot of cool area's and you can view memories giving more back story to the characters.  But with skipping it you dont need to make it a priority. 

Thats basically it for the con's theres other small stuff you can gripe about but it doesnt change the big picture of the game.  
The game is a ton of fun and with all the very beautiful and detailed scenery you might not even want to fast travel around the combat is enjoyable and isnt annoying or tedious to do. The first time playing i died to this one enemy so much but i didnt feel annoyed i kept going back at it and trying different ways to try and fight him soon i noticed an hour passed and it didnt bother me at all that constant fight was enjoyable and trying to figure out new ways to win this fight without getting my face kicked in was great.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is another strong entry in the series, delivering a stunningly handcrafted world that feels immersive and alive. The story is engaging, and I genuinely love the characters, though at times, the exposition in critical moments feels a bit bland.

The dual protagonists work surprisingly well. Despite the discourse around Yasuke, he fits into the story like a glove and is actually a really cool character. That said, I find myself playing as Naoe more often—it feels like the developers put extra care into her character. On my hoepeful second playthrough, I plan to do a full canon run to experience the game as intended. The ally system is seamlessly integrated, and the hideout—a feature I didn’t expect in an AC game—adds a nice touch. While modded, I still find myself spending a few minutes there each session.

Gameplay-wise, it’s fantastic, though I’ve modded it slightly to better suit my playstyle (another plus for its Steam release). Traversal is different from Valhalla, which I loved. In comparison, Valhalla’s biggest flaw was its sheer length—it felt like Ubisoft wanted players to sink into its world for years, but they release games so frequently that there’s barely time to fully absorb one before the next arrives. I miss the eagles though.

The unguided exploration is a bit hit-or-miss—sometimes it’s rewarding, but other times I feel clueless. I wish there were more NPC interactions to help with discovery instead of relying so much on scouts, who can be vague at times. Eventually, I switched back to guided mode. The pathfinder, while initially annoying, does prove useful but still annoying.

However, my biggest gripe is the forced Ubisoft Connect sign-in. It’s not a great launcher, and it sometimes logs me out or gets weirdly unresponsive. It’s frustrating having to deal with that just to play a game I own on Steam.

Overall, Shadows is a beautiful game with solid gameplay and an engaging world. If you’re an AC fan, especially one who enjoys tweaking the experience with mods, this is definitely worth playing—just be prepared for the occasional headache with Ubisoft’s launcher.",True,0,1,1742973324,76561198334920990,1890

191206807,english,"I've been deeply disturbed with the games ubisoft has been putting out lately between horrible titles to unpolished buggy messes. But this is a step in the right direction and I feel like they actually tried with this game. I could drone on about different things I liked but its better if I number it.
.1 The game Has a great story so far that doesn't fall off half way through the game
.2 Even on a 1920x1080 monitor the graphics are smooth with no frame rate issues
.3 The combat feels nice not over complicated or too easy and fights don't last forever
.4 The new movement animations are great feels more fluid to move around and not so clunky as it felt in Valhalla
.5 This is more of a point than anything but the inclusion of lgbt characters isn't much of a problem it's just apart of the society we live with now but it's not mandatory to the game romance isn't apart of the canon for the game and if you play with the canon mode enabled you wont have to.

Review:

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is, in my opinion, the best entry in the series. I know some people won't like me saying that but it's how I feel. — right up there with Black Flag and Odyssey. The graphics are absolutely stunning, with refined mechanics and stealth that feel more polished than ever. The combat and traversal are smooth, and the visual fidelity, especially with ray tracing, is incredible.

The voice acting, while divisive, is actually well done. The story delivers impactful and exciting moments, with the end of Act 1 featuring some of my favorite scenes in the entire franchise. The music deserves praise too—it perfectly complements the narrative, drawing you deeper into the experience.

On the technical side, the game runs flawlessly on my rig (Ryzen 9800X3D, RTX 5070 Ti, 64 GB RAM), even with ray tracing enabled. It’s clearly well-optimized, though performance may vary on older hardware I'm sure.

Pros:

🎯 Stunning visuals with excellent ray tracing implementation

🐱‍👤 Refined stealth and combat mechanics

🎵 Immersive soundtrack that enhances emotional moments

🌊 Strong optimization with current hardware

📜 Compelling story with memorable moments


Cons:

🗡️ Some may find the acting divisive

⚙️ Performance on older hardware may vary

👋 Not without its bugs. - Hopefully fixed with updates.

Final Thoughts:

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is easily my second-favorite entry in the series, only behind Black Flag. If you’re an AC fan, don’t skip this one—it might just be your GOTY.

Assassin's Creed Shadows transports players to 16th-century Japan, offering a rich blend of historical intrigue and immersive gameplay. Players navigate the tumultuous Sengoku period through the eyes of two protagonists: Naoe, a stealthy shinobi from the Iga clan, and Yasuke, a samurai of African descent serving under Oda Nobunaga.

**Visuals and Setting**

The game's depiction of feudal Japan is nothing short of breathtaking. From the bustling streets of Kyoto to the serene temples of Iga, every locale is meticulously crafted, capturing the era's essence. The dynamic ""Atmos"" system introduces real-time seasonal and weather changes, further enhancing the immersive experience.

**Gameplay Mechanics**

Assassin's Creed Shadows introduces a dual-protagonist system, allowing players to switch between Naoe and Yasuke, each offering distinct gameplay styles. Naoe emphasizes stealth, utilizing agility and tactics to outmaneuver foes, while Yasuke relies on strength and direct combat. This design provides varied gameplay experiences, catering to different player preferences. However, some critics felt that the RPG elements, such as repetitive quests and leveling mechanics, detracted from the overall experience.

**Narrative and Historical Representation**

The intertwining stories of Naoe and Yasuke delve into themes of identity, belonging, and honor. While the inclusion of Yasuke, a historical African samurai, adds depth, some players debated its historical accuracy and relevance. Japanese critics, however, praised the portrayal, focusing more on minor inaccuracies and the game's immersive qualities. citeturn0news10

**Critical Reception**

The game has received generally favorable reviews. Metacritic scores stand at 81/100 for PS5, 85/100 for Xbox Series X/S, and 78/100 for PC, reflecting a positive consensus. citeturn0search4 IGN lauded the game's open-world design, calling it ""one of the best versions of the open-world style it's been honing for the last decade.""  Conversely, PC Gamer criticized the repetitive RPG mechanics, stating that the game ""proves too repetitive and dramatically flat to wholeheartedly recommend taking its trip back in time."" 

**Conclusion**

Assassin's Creed Shadows stands as a visually stunning and ambitious entry in the franchise. Its rich depiction of feudal Japan and the innovative dual-protagonist system offer fresh perspectives. While some gameplay elements may feel familiar or repetitive, the game's strengths in storytelling and world-building make it a noteworthy experience for both newcomers and long-time fans of the series.",True,0,0,1742962999,76561198046607255,8647

I personally don't understand the noise around ""$70 singleplayer game with microtransactions"" because:
1. A good amount of the people complaining about it don't even own the game or have never even played a single assassin's creed title.
2. They're completely optional and not spending on them doesn't change the experience of the game at all. They said it themselves, it's singleplayer. If anything, you're gonna be paying for over the top cosmetics that look out of the place in the world.
3. They're not visible outside of the landing page with news and the animus hub. Heck, I didn't even know the animus hub existed until I randomly completed a weekly quest. The ""battle passes"" are completely free by the way and are available forever.

191199835,english,"Crashes intermittently due to a DirectX error (DX12 Error - some hex code).

As for the game content itself: Starts at the end of the tyranny of Oda Nobunaga. For those unaware, Oda (clan/family name) Nobunaga (first name) was a very real man, who in the mid-to-late 1570's, was the first to nearly unify all of Japan during its ""warring states"" period under his rule. He was purportedly (this is real world history, here) an absolute master of logistics, but also something of a tyrant. He didn't quite completely unify Japan under his absolute rule, but came close before he died June 21, 1582, when shortly thereafter one of his allies, Tokugawa Ieyasu, picked up the work and finished the job, finally totally unifying all of Japan under the Tokugawa Shogunate, ending a ridiculously long period of constant multiple simultaneous civil wars.

The game starts toward the end of Oda Nobunaga's period, following two characters - a young woman from a peasant family who is crushed and brought under heel by Nobunaga's army - and a soldier who serves in that army. Years later, as a young orphan named Noae seeks revenge for her father's murder by killing Oda Nobunaga himself, she's stopped cold by the largest samurai she's ever seen - Nobunaga's ""one man army"", Yasuke - an emancipated Portugese slave - who nearly kills her in defense of his Lord.

Until he sees the hidden blade on her wrist; the one her father gave her with his dying breath.

""Yasuke! KILL HER!""
""I WILL NOT!""

It's a fantastic plot, ruined by a game that just...crashes! I've requested a refund from Steam twice who automated the ""NOPE!"" (have they replaced all the humans with bots up there?), so I've got no other recourse here.

This is why we can't have nice things.

Ubisoft: I will be happy to re-evaluate this review with an eye toward other aspects of the game on 3 conditions: (a) my nearly $100 USD is returned (all of it), (b) you fix that DX12 error for everyone, and (c) I keep the game here on Steam as your show of good faith; a ""yeah, sorry dude, you're right - we messed up, we should have done better."" Contact me privately and I'm happy to securely transmit a copy of my receipt from Sony showing I bought it over there, which bears the PSN username that you can use to verify with them. We all know this won't happen because it requires you to make an effort, but the offer stands because I'm telling the truth.

It's a real shame - I've been an AC fan for decades. And I continue to be because the concept and plot are (usually) just incredible. But what it's become due to the pressure to crank out another product every N years, the ""sales and product"" over ""creativity, narrative and fun"", the formulaic approach that's taken control at Ubisoft has clearly been the reason that this storied franchise no longer bears the respect it once did. I long for the days you all return to such roots, and encourage you to do so. You'll earn new fans that stick around for decades, just like I have, if you do.

EDIT: Comments have been enabled. Keep the discussion respectful toward everyone, please. And for the love of $DIETY, no debate about woke/anti-woke, I've heard enough of that crap and I don't care either way: troll out. Merits of the game itself, please.",False,0,0,1742961027,76561198011833168,352
191199776,english,"Graphics are nice.

• Landscapes are A LOT better than the old trilogy. Every step and angle looks like a photography. It's no longer a grass plain with a few rocks and trees, they are all interesting to explore and appreciate.

• The new cutscenes are great.

• I like how the protagonists participate in social events, parties and meetings from Feudal Japan. It makes these stories and characters more believables. Very immersive.

• Touching story with interesting character development. So far the best story I've seen in an AC game in a long time.

• Less Ubisoft-like icons. A way more natural and dynamic approach to exploration.

• Loot is less important, so leaving chests behind on outspots is not as punished as in the old trilogy. Finding chests now feels interesting, not a chore, which is nice.

• More varied game play loop: no longer based merely on visiting outposts - killing everyone - looting everything - finding next outpost. We now have housing, dynamic events, interesting side activities... More variation.

• Optimization is great. This game is running the same tech as Monster Hunter Wilds, which shortens development times at the cost of performance. However, AC Shadows runs pretty much ""as good as it can"" with the tech it's using.  


The combat style has received some tweaks, but I still don't think a souls-like combat gameplay fits Assassin's Creed. This game is supposed to be immersive, cool and badass. It should focus on looking realistic, cool and badass, not o focusing the enemy and rotate around him waiting for a parry like this is Dark Souls. Stabbing an enemy 67 times in a realistic immersive game like Assassin's Creed feels off and these janky goofy ass souls-like combat animations are absolutely immersion breaking.

• Naoe is the true protagonist. Not because Yasuke isn't cool or anything, but because he is so heavily nerfed in core mechanics he can't even reach some of the collectables: Yasuke can't climb and he is almost useless in stealth, while Naoe can do everything and she is simply a little bit less effective in combat (but she can still parry, block and deal damage). I like Yasuke as a character, but I'm having such a difficult time playing as him... Not being able to parkour nor do some basic stealth on an Assassin's Creed game is horrendous and such a huge nerf compared to what Naoe gets, which is simply a small combat damage reduction. There are not a lot of reasons to play as Yasuke and I think most people will simply stick to using Naoe, I think this has not been properly balanced nor considered and it kind of destroys the whole point of having two protagonists.


 The game has a pretty weird personality I don't fully enjoy. It tries to incorporate japanese action and scenery elements typical from mangas or japanese cinematography, mixed with an intention of feeling youthful and modern... The mixure is weird and I don't know how to feel about it. I think it would have been preferable sticking to an OG PS3-era Assassin's Creed style, or a full classical japanese personality in the style of Ghost of Tsushima. This weird modern middle point is a little bit awkward sometimes.

• The game has some minor but frustrating bugs. Sometimes the music stops working and you have to quit and re-enter the game to get it back working. I've also encountered some instances where I assessinate enemies but they get up again with full health, putting an end to my stealth run. Pretty sure they'll get these fixed soon though, it's still a very polished game and I've not encountered any more major issues.

• While the new dialogue cameras are great, they still need to work on expressions. They still feel a little soul-less and robotic.


Pretty good Assassin's Creed game so far. Enjoying it a lot. Fixes a lot of issues from previous AC RPG games such as those uninteresting landscapes (which now look amazing in Shadows), but also carries some of the issues from those ones such as the absolutely horrendous combat system.

It has some rough edges, but it's a pretty good Assassin's Creed game and, in my opinion, the best RPG-style game they have released so far.

Balancing issues here and there like how I'm always sliding down a hill I'm trying to climb up with Naoe, but I can charge right up it with Yasuke. Maybe if she could use her grappling hook to climb steep hills or ability to unlock ""shuko"" to climb up most terrain. I mean if Alexios can make his own footholds I don't see why we can't at this point. As for the whole hubbub of how it's not culturally accurate, well I don't think any of the AC games are historically accurate and are just historically based.

Not an Assassin’s Creed fan. Lost track after AC II. Tried Syndicate, Black Flag, Valhalla, Ezio… but never really committed. When I say AC, I mean the game, seriously... Some are new to this game. 

Just the world, the mechanics, the feeling of being somewhere else. I’m not in it for lore or accuracy. I just like exploring cool spaces and challenging myself in my own way. This game caught my attention for that reason alone

And in that sense, Shadows actually delivers. The world is beautiful. The animations feel buttery smooth, to an extent, tbh. The parkour is back to being something fun again, as long as you're really putting effort to explore and experience different situations and execute their animation...

Which can also be improved, but i mean, it's time for another AC, but sometimes, even when they're factory-sealed, they come broke. - Intended indeed.

I don’t really mess with fantasy games and I know this isn’t historically accurate. Doesn’t matter. It’s inspired by real places and traditions, and it uses that to build something stunning. 

Not accurate, not realistic, but beautiful. And that’s enough for me...

[b]Then it all fell apart[/b]

After the cutscene where Yasuke beheads the living shyt outta his neck, the game just crashes. Every time. Cutscene plays. Black screen. Boom. Crash. Skip the scene? Still crashes. Reload the save? Same story

I tried everything. lowered settings, turned off all overlays. Cleared shader cache. Forced DX11. Verified files. Tried launching it from Ubisoft instead of Steam. Nothing helped. Scene was just broken on my end

So I caved and tried a save file that starts right after that cutscene. It worked. The game ran past that point. But it also gave me a bunch of Steam achievements, maxed out my character, skipped past content I wanted to experience myself. 

Didn’t feel like my game anymore. I went back to my original save to see if the crash cleared. It didn’t. Still broke. Still stuck, so now I’m left with a busted save or someone else’s journey. And that ain’t how I like to play

But here’s the thing. Even with all that, this is still the best blind preorder I’ve made in years. I didn’t read previews. Didn’t study gameplay breakdowns. I just felt like trying something new and this felt right. 

Last time I did that V (Another title) and it gave me that same kind of spark. That gut feeling that this is something cool, even if it’s not polished yet

If you’re like me, playing for the experience more than the story or stats, you might still love this game when it works. It gives you the space to make your own fun

If you don’t like it, refund it. If you’re curious, maybe wait for a patch. If you’re a believer, this might be worth keeping on your drive.  It feels like a strong game underneath all the bugs. Probably just needs a bit more time and the right hardware combo

This isn’t a fan defending the series. Just a man who found something worth talking about, even if it broke on me halfway through

If you’re reading this and facing the same issue, I’ve included every fix I tried at the end here. Feel free to copy them, post them, expand on them, or make your own version, or a guide of your own. If it helps someone else get back into the game without losing their story, it’s worth it

Worked (That's a lie.) for me... But it also: 
- Unlocked a bunch of Steam achievements
- Maxed out the character
- Jumped ahead in the story

It technically fixed the crash but also broke the sense of discovery
Use it if you really want to keep going and nothing else works. Just know the trade-offs... And they're bad. Real talk.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a beautiful, broken experience. It gave me some of the most immersive moments I’ve had in a game lately
And then it crashed into a wall I couldn’t climb
I’m still glad I bought it
But I hope they fix it

191195689,english,"The best AC game since Black Flag. I highly recommend Assassin's Creed fans to play on Expert difficulty. The stealth on expert is so much more realistic than any previous game. Now that enemies aren't oblivious to what is above them, you have to completely change how you play. With that, the ability to go prone is a game changer. Crawling through the grass just feels right. The only thing that's missing is the crowd stealth, which is a staple of the series, but for this setting it makes sense that it would not be a major component. 

Some other things I like:
- The hair animations/physics are incredible 
- Combat feels great with both characters (same as stealth, you've gotta play on Expert for the best experience)
- The grappling hook is really fun
- Naoe is stupid fast both in movement and combat 

Some things that are lacking:
- There are less interesting side things to do on the map compared to Valhalla. 
- Sometimes the 'Assassinate' prompt is not given at certain angles, especially from above.

Overall, it's a great game and feels like a revival to the series. While I did enjoy some of the other RPG style games, this one really eliminated a lot of the problems that I, and many other AC fans had with the newer games.

The game is enjoyable and the Japanese atmosphere that the game attempts to create is excellent. It combines the soothing country side ambiance with the brutal reality of feudal japan. The story is good in the same way that all AC stories are good - that is to say that they've shoe-horned in an assassins creed story into a tiny part of history. Mechanically the game is a backstep in some ways; the shadow stealth is a good forward direction but some of the parkour and running has been lost - this was most evident when attempting to navigate running and jumping on any of the ships. This seems to be janky and a backslide from black flag. I also was not fully impressed, that in order to run it at all, i needed to download it to an SSD (as opposed to my normal HHDs). The shuttering and cut-scenes are unplayable on a traditional HHD. The RPG item elements play less of a roll in this game that previous AC games (eg. unity etc), and they feel like a cosmetic addon that hasn't fully been abandoned. The creation of your own hideout is a good forward step but it seems relatively subpar compared to the implementation in other similar games. 

Overall it checks my boxes. It is an Assassins Creed game. It has a historical background. It downplays mythical stuff (unlike Odyssey). It has forward momentum for the franchise. It is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. I get to stealth and assassinate targets.",True,0,0,1742955081,76561198041847283,1862

The movement always feels cheap, characters generic, and map is horrendous, not to mention the DLC and cosmetics.

But comparing this to Ghost of Tsushima, one of my favorite games of all time, this game is pretty good. 

Ghost of Tsushima certainly has better combat, its more polished, the story i enjoyed much more and the voice acting is great. Its more stylized and because of that, has less detail.

This assassins creed thought has an unbelievable amount of detail in the world. After playing this, I have high expectations for Ghost of Yotei, i really hope they can make some major improvements to the world. The story isnt too bad either, and while it certainly does seem like an odd choice for a black samurai, the story is great. There is more i could say but put simply, I'm an ubisoft hater, and this game is great. I really hope they take the good from this game and keep growing on it, they would really make something even better. The movement feels much better than past games, though still nowhere near as nice as RDR2 or some other third person games, but getting there.

By far the best part about the game is the world/seasons/visuals. There are very few games that make me want to walk slowly through them and this is one. The physics based environment and destruction is a rare thing to see a game focus on and is something I greatly appreciate, as well as the seasons genuinely affecting gameplay.

The core combat is a strong 7.5. What weighs it down is very few finishers and sometimes attacks don't land or don't land as hard as you would think they should. Other than that it is fine and by far requires the most attention from you as a player compared to all the other AC games.

For exploration, you are encouraged to use the main roads or premade paths, mainly because the forests in this game are THICK! And that is no joke. You can barely see where you are going if you decide to beeline for your objectives. Its possible for sure, but not much fun when you can barely see.

The narrative is... okay? Its by far the weakest aspect of the game sadly. A AAA company has no excuses for these many non-mocapped cutscenes. It feels like an extreme cost saving measure frankly. With that being said, the cutscenes that are good, are GOOD, and I was invested in them, but sadly they are spaced too far apart. The performances of the cast are also extremely variable. Sometimes they sound like they are half asleep and other times they are stellar. Its almost like they sometimes had no context to work off of for some of these quests and were told to just wing it.

Overall I recommend this game if you have any interest in the RPG formula or pretty good stealth gameplay. If you are a diehard old-school style AC fan, this will probably change nothing for you and I would avoid wasting your money.",True,0,0,1742953938,76561198176745659,1645

I'm happy to skip Odyssey and Valhalla for being more about combat than any other games in the series, and padded to be too long. Origins was at least kinda new for the series, so it was an all right game, but Shadows is still more fun than it. Maybe I'll try the immersive mode for the supposed better VAs speaking Japanese. [b]Dumb[/b] controversy: If Yasuke received a stipend, home, his own servants, and wakizashi with decorated sheath, rode with Nobunaga, dined with him, had private conversations with him, was chosen as his bodyguard, then it's not far-fetched to believe he was at the very least [b]treated[/b] as a samurai, or that Nobunaga had plans to make him one. Only a samurai can be a lord's sword bearer, and while we have no record of Yasuke with this title, he was recorded to be seen carrying out duties of a koshō and sword bearer to Oda Nobunaga. Japanese historians say in this period a master could promote his servant any time regardless of social status, and there is record of gossip that Nobunaga planned to make Yasuke a lord. We'll never know the inner thoughts of a centuries dead warlord, during a war that featured sub-classes of samurai while many were being recruited.

----Japanese historians who suggested Yasuke might have been a samurai include Hiraku Kaneko and Oka Mihoko. The general consensus among historians is that there is insufficient evidence to conclude Yasuke was a samurai. The prominent Yūichi Goza said, ""The text then indicates that this means he was [b]treated[/b] as a samurai. [...]even if he was a samurai, he was a samurai in name-only.""

Historical fiction is more interesting with jumping off points from reality. One of the closest people to Nobunaga is featured in this historical fiction. Japan's PM was only angry that shrines could be climbed, monk NPCs killed, and sacred items of temples destroyed. Ubisoft apologized and removed that in the day 1 patch.

'Hideki Kamiya congratulated Ubisoft on 2 million players, and in a follow up post noted that a ""majority of normal people"" have been silent as compared to the vocal minority of outraged gamers.'

Enjoy being the vocal minority complaining on behalf of a nation and culture you don't belong to, or have any interactions with. Japan has made dramatizations of Yasuke as a samurai in modern media since 1968. In the canon mode of the game there are zero romances. Find something else to center your personality around. If you think Yasuke was a pet to be paraded while receiving all these perks, then I wonder what use (or gifts) Nobunaga would have had for you.",True,0,0,1742952960,76561198054900407,1228

Although the parkour was a small down grade from ac mirage, its good and usable. Also stop with all the flips, its a bit excessive. As for the the direct combat like with all the ac game it better but still should not be the main focus, hence the name ""assassin"". With that in mind Yasuke's focus became more of a hindrance to both the games potential story and exploration. As a long ac fan and played all but ac games except Valhalla, his character just didn't really fit regardless of his race. The story could have focused on the Templar's invasion of Japan and the shinobi/ ninja connection the the creed,to both draw out and defend their sacred land and kill the the ones being influenced by the Templar's. All the while taking in refugees who have lost the home and ideals and creation mini rebellion factions, which could be used for scouting and what not. However if need, you could have made Yasuke in to a Templar dog who back stabbed Naoe later through the story. After securing some larger victory against the Templar's. For example that hideout and the people you secured, could be wiped out and he pulls a move like Anakin. Then it become a plot for revenge.

AC has always been my one of my favorite series simply because of the premise, even through the ups and downs, and this game finally achieves what I personally have been aching for, for a long time. It seems to me that they've taken the best parts of the past dozen games and put it all in here. The combat is incredibly fun and diverse if you take note of what you can actually do, the parkour and stealth is mindful and refreshing and surprising. It is incredibly, impeccably BEAUTIFUL, and though it has quite a lot of similarities with Ghost of Tsushima, I feel like they did certain things better. 

My only gripes are that I'd like to be able to BOW on command like Ghost, but I also can understand the difference here. I guess I just like bowing lol. That, and I do love the assassin v templar story which has been lacking for a long time, but I also recognize that this is early AC timeline, and there are certainly early creed elements here, more so than other early timeline installments. I also miss the ability to equip and unequip the hood without having to enter inventory, but I also understand that that would make more sense in later timeline games, when the creed is more established.

191191681,english,"i dont know how to write so im just going to list pros and cons
Pros:
- the stealth gameplay is very good and rewarding
- the combat while not being my preferred method is pretty good and can have a decent amount of depth
- the story has be pretty good so far, there was a particular moment at the end of act 1 that made me get a little teary eyed
- the amount of ways to customize your game play experience is something i really like (immersive mode, cannon mode, guaranteed assassination, being able to customize the difficulty of combat and stealth separately)
-the music is great, has that classic Japanese music mixed with some subtle futuristic(?) music, idk how to describe it but it fits with the tone of the series

Cons:
-parkour is nonexistent (to some this isn't and issue but for most ac fans this is a disappointment and if you've played any of the first four games you know how good it used to be)
-micro transactions (tho so far they haven't be too intrusive and ive been able to ignore them thus far. remains to be seen if endgame becomes at all grindy and requires them) (if you get this game never use the micro transactions not even for a joke)
- you need to have the game installed a SSD and no a HDD otherwise the game will run like shit. this is so weird considering i can run cyberpunk on my HDD just fine
-the the cutscence camera direction and animations are a little weird and kind of sterile mostly with the all the ones apart with side quests. thats a minor thing i know but i just thought id mention it

overall is game is pretty good tho there are a couple flaws but in my opinion the pros out-way the cons. out of 10 i give the game a 8.5 so far, if my opinion about something changes the game continues ill update this review",True,0,0,1742949769,76561198293845343,5049

191187122,english,"First of all, where do I come from: I loved the Ezio games. Black Flag and my most favourite AC game was Odyssey for the different builds you could make and gear to collect. <3 <3 Kassandra <3 <3 
Didn't like AC Valhalla at all for the above reason of limited strict gear progression... 

This game is a really hard one to rate good or bad. It is somewhere inbetween mediocre. Maybe the best word to describe. 
I could write an 5 page long essay about what i like, but no one wants that I guess ;)  so in short my pros and cons. 

Pro: 
- Challenging stealth
- lights and shaders are great
- rain and storm weather effects
- animations and pacour
- Base buildng (if you are into that sort of thing. I'm not, but I guess most like that)

Cons: 
- Story --> biggest fail   it is so bad, even Chat GPT could write a better one... 
- Open world.   Hardly have I ever had a game where exploring feels punishing. More of this down below. 
- Characters

The Problem is .. I really liked the game for the first 5-10 hours. Primarily for the things I saw the first time that were great (graphics, animations, weapon and equipment). It is normal, that you need to give the story some time to get hooked. I thought it just needed time. 

In the pro and con list you can clearly see my problem. Everything ""good"" suffers from ""diminishing return"". Graphics are great at the beginning but you get used to it. Same with animations and stuff. 
Things that would keep you hooked should be the complex characters, character progression und story. All of which the game just does not deliver. 

The  most interesting thing in the story, in my opinion, is Yasuke. 

At the moment (30 hours in) is, that it is extremely repetive, story is sh*** and world exploring is not rewarding and extremy annoying due to the terrain. 

Honestly, get Ghost of Tsushima instead. ...   AC Shadows made me install that game again

*** Open World
I have a big problem with the AC Open World. 
Traveling from A to B is just not great. 
a) Terrain is bad. Always not traversable hills and dense forests in the way, where you can hardly get though. 
Traveling by road lacks the ""auto-follow road"" feature to at least enjoy the nature. That feature sadly didn't make it to this game although nearly all predecessors had it. 
b) You can choose a character, that is, except you cant. Some View-Poins can't be reached by Yasuke, so you have to constantly switch to Naoe for exploration and to Yasuke (if you don't like stealth) for combat. 
c) There is literally NOTHING TO SEE in the open world. Such an empty shell,I guess very randomly generated to make the world big but without substance .... just bad.

I could write  a lot more complains, but you get the idea. 

My conclusion: 
Visually appealing but an empty shell.",False,0,0,1742944094,76561198042947950,1726
191187104,english,"As someone who has played and completed every Assassin’s Creed game, I went into Assassin’s Creed Shadows with high expectations. Unfortunately, the first 30 minutes shattered any hope I had.
From the moment I launched the game, the audio and video were completely out of sync, making cut scenes unbearable. Before I could even start playing, the game crashed twice. And when it finally ran, it struggled on the lowest settings—on a PC that can handle most modern titles at high to medium settings.
Ubisoft is charging a premium for this game while expecting players to own high-end supercomputers. If they can’t optimize their games properly, maybe they should consider selling the company to someone who can, anyone who can pay developers better instead of relying on ""passion"" to make a game. Right now, it feels like Shadows was built on rushed development and cheap labour rather than actual effort or care for the franchise.

I get why they wanted to mix it up with the RPG style combat because doing the same parry into oneshot of the previous style was bound to get boring, but this doesn't really grow that style in any meaningful way so it's still just mediocre.

As most people have said, this is a pretty middle of the road experience in terms of AC, and if you have enjoyed the previous modern titles you will probably like this one as well.

Also for what it is worth I think the exploration in this is much better than any of the previous modern AC games.

Characters are mostly charismatic, especially when they interact with each other and GOD DAMN Yasuke's flashbacks are fantastically directed (so is one early scene with Naoe). In general the game finally introduced ACto good direction in its cutscenes, so that's great. Music is also one on the better side of the spectrum, not Ezio's Family levels, but still pretty good.

Gameplay-wise - combat is worse than Tsushima (also it still suffers from ubisoft's intention to make AC into an RPG), but other than that, everything else's much more diverse. They finally decided to not make parkour animations horrible, which is a huge plus. Took them 4 games to find lost technologies of pre Syndicate AC games.

I'd say that if RPG ACs wasn't your cup of tea completely (or if AC in general wasn't you thing) - you won't get anything that will impress you here, but if you liked some parts of those games, this is a VAST improvement in pretty much every area (except for RPG stuff with levels and enemies autoscaling... whoever keeps doing it - I would personally like to suggest you kiss the hole between my buttocks).",True,0,0,1742939441,76561197993679603,3259

 The game-play loop is....expected. Go here > talk to person > gather intel > return to person > kill person from gathered intel. WHICH if you're looking for something ""new"" in the series, then i'd recommend waiting for this to be on sale or look else ware.

 My main gripe with this game is the splitting of the 2 main characters and having basically 2 stories wound up into 1.  There are some parts where I want to play as Naoe instead of Yasuke through some main missions. Granted you can do that on a 2nd playthrough, but still its kind of a bummer. Also while on that topic, Naoe's gameplay is true traditional Assassins Creed style that i have definitely favored over Yasuke's.  No disrespect to the guy, and there are moments where it is fun to just go HAM with a beefy brawler (basically Linebacker) sort of character. The game is Assassins Creed, not Samurai Agent Linebacker. Playing Yasuke is bulky and honestly annoying. Good luck attempting to be stealthy while playing as him.

It's still very much an AC title though and everything from the previous titles is here, so buyer beware if you've gotten a little tired of the repetitive mechanics over the years. 

It could do with some more optimisation and absolutely NEEDS to have the cut-scene frame rate unlocked from 30fps and properly rendered in real time (it's so jarring and immersion breaking currently); but I'd recommend this title to series veterans and newbies alike.

Its still an RPG game which means it still has an insane amount of bloat and tacked on RPG mechanics but the core gameplay is so strong that I can easily put my issues with those parts of the game aside. 

If Ubisoft takes anything away from this game it should be that this (plus social stealth) should be the new standard for Assassin's Creed stealth. If they build off this foundation, and return to the original structure (Pre-Origins) they will have a winning formula on their hands.

If you liked Ghost Of Tsushima, this game feels about the same so it's nice to get that style of gameplay in a new part of Japan with a different story and interesting characters! However, if you're an OG Assassin's Creed fan and reject the RPG formula, this game isn't for you, it follows the standards set by the likes of Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla so be aware of that before purchasing it. The gorgeous visuals and world design is definitely doing a lot of the heavy lifting, but the overall gameplay is far from being mediocre. Where the game can get frustrating, much like its recent predecessors, is how repetitive the various activities can get.

It is a joy to explore and quest in, and I highly suggest putting the language in Immersive Mode. The quest ""board"" makes completing tasks a lot more free-form and intuitive.

191178387,english,"AC Shadows is a fascinating game. 
I am a modestly experienced veteran of a few previous AC games, Ive played:
The OG
Revelations
AC III
Black Flag
Origins
Odyssey
Valhalla

Shadows is a great game, at least in my opinion. I am enjoying it a lot, i think about it when i'm not playing, and i'm frequently excited by stuff happening in it. It is not a perfect game by any means, it has a ton of flaws you could pick at. But it has so many great things too, that the experience is net positive by a large degree

Ill address the elephant in the pagoda first

Yasuke is not the protagonist. He's sort of a co-protagonist, but he is definitely the lesser of the two in many ways. You don't even get him for the first 10-15 hours of the game, you're gonna be learning Naoe's hopes and dreams and how to do ninja stuff.
And while you can choose to play either of them at any time, you will frequently run into stuff that yasuke can't do, like advanced climbing and stealth, so you're gonna switch back to her anyway. So no matter what your decisions, you will spend the majority of the time playing as the girl.  This is the Naoe show, yasuke is just along for the ride. 

Since AC Origins, the franchise has taken a different direction, with more of a focus on stats, numbers and gear. This has been divisive, but personally I am on the favourable side, I like this direction, at least in theory. In practise it has been done somewhat badly over origins, odyssey and valhalla, the three i've played with this system. Gear is rarer and more frequent, assassinations are more reliable and clear, skills and weapons are more interesting. This core gameplay pillar works better than it ever has before. It is an iteration and refinement, not a reinvention, but i like it.

The architecture is amazing. Ive wanted to ninja around japanese castles for so long, and here it is. Every castle is beautiful, richly detailed, and fully exploreable, inside and out. The interiors are so cozy, they feel small but not cramped, it makes me want to stop doing ninja stuff and just live in them. The scale, beauty and complexity of them is astounding. I found one with concentric rings of walls and moats that was a labyrinth to navigate. Most castles are, you step inside the grounds and its like another world, full of rich targets and beautiful places to hide the bodies. All the overhangs and sloped roofs are pretty functional too, the geography of the world has a huge effect on where and how you hide. Which is greatly accentuated by the new ability to lie prone and crawl around, big upgrade to stealth

I love the pacing. Its based around seasons. Every couple of realtime hours, the season ingame changes, and with it, the entire world. Trees lose leaves, weather patterns differ, winter has dynamic snow on everything. It gives a feeling of life to this universe. The change of a season also resets your wanted level, and various ingame resources, like restocking scouts. It feels natural, and peaceful. Most of the time at least, but the storms are terrifying, and the audio of it is fascinating. Harsh storms combined with comfy interiors mean that i often find myself taking shelter indoors, listening to the rain pound on the roofs outside. There is no gameplay purpose to this at all, but the ambience is peak and the vibes are immaculate

I love the little things, like how people take their shoes off indoors, the creaky nightingale floors in castles, the way naoe does unnecessary flips when you hit the dodge button, the prevalence of inlaid gold and silks on so many fabrics and environmental details, the way towns are laid out with beautiful little gardens

The AI and stealth are both vastly improved, and i'm not sure about this. Guards are now hyper realistic in their visibility. They see your face poking around corners, they see your leg sticking out above a roof, they see tiny parts of you through any gaps in geometry. Nothing gets past them, and it makes stealth punishingly hard. Good if you like a challenge, but it can be frustrating

One thing ive really loved in AC games is the eclectic cast of victims for your stabbing. Its nice to have a checklist of bizarre bad guys to hunt down, and AC shadows goes really over the top with this. First you get a list of targets for the big secret society, but then you keep getting other sub lists of targets. They have different themes that keep it interesting, i'm enjoying hunting down corrupted merchants and robbing them blind instead of killing them.

And on that note, i like the resource economy. You've got background tallies keeping track of crops, wood, minerals, money, iron, cloth, and a bunch of other things. These seem like noise at first, but gradually come into more focus, not less, as you start to think about the things you need them for. There's nothing quite like running out of something to make you really appreciate it the next time you find it, and i get a bizarre cathartic joy from stumbling across a stack of timber i can take home. Its mostly used for the hideout construction mechanic, which is another thing i thought i wouldn't care about, but am gradually growing to like. It essentially acts as a second skill tree, with various buildings offering incremental upgrades to various areas of your power, allies, gear, etc.

Its all very gamified, but this is a videogame, and i've got the difficulty maxed out so i have to struggle hard to make headway, it makes me appreciate all those little bonuses. The high difficulty is the pillar that everything else builds on, bringing all these little side mechanics into meaningful focus. This game offers a strong feeling of incremental growth and improvement which i love

But even while i'm thinking this, i stop, in the middle of a windblown path through the forest, autumn leaves streaming by all around me. The sheer beauty of this in a moment to moment basis is practically unparallelled. Its one of the prettiest worlds ive ever seen, rich with detail and wonder, and this brings me back to earth whenever i get lost in the numbers. 

AC Shadows is a treat for all the senses. It makes my brain think in nice ways, but also pokes me in the soul. I struggle to find criticisms because i am constantly amazed at the great things, and discovering more every day.   It may not be for everyone, but a game for everyone is a game for noone.

Only things they need to improve is some work on blood FX they feel kind of weird in some places, also they need to refine their fight animations they good but not so fluid, I will say add some more moves or fight animations instead of same animation playing again. Ubisoft should take some inspiration from black flag, for eg yasuke has just of 2 punch animation, which feel really bad, they could add some more animations and could have made it really good, cause the graphics are great. 

Rest I will say story is good but the English VA are just bad,  Japanese VA are great. English voice line does not hit that well. 

Now will I recommend it, YES if you are a assassins creed fan you should play, this 100%. If you are new to this series just wait for sale of you guys dont want to spend 90$ on the game.

191176224,english,"Alright, buckle up, because Assassin's Creed Shadows just redefined what it means to experience history! I'm absolutely floored. Let's dive right into the heart of it:

Cons (Honestly, I'm stretching here):

Might require a truly top-tier rig to experience its full, breathtaking glory. I mean, we're talking next-gen visuals here.
The sheer depth of the world might overwhelm some players at first. There's just... so much to do.
Mastering both playable characters' unique combat styles takes dedication (but it's SO worth it!).
The historical accuracy is so immersive, you might forget to eat.
PROOOOOOSSS!!!

The visuals? Forget everything you thought you knew. This isn't just a game; it's a living, breathing painting. The lighting, the textures, the sheer detail of feudal Japan... it's beyond anything I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating when I say it is a visual masterpiece.
The dual protagonist system is a stroke of genius! Switching between the stealthy shinobi and the powerful samurai provides such a rich, varied gameplay experience. Each character's story is gripping, and their interactions are pure gold.
The world is alive! Every NPC feels like they have a purpose, every location is meticulously crafted, and the level of historical detail is mind-blowing. You're not just playing a game; you're stepping into a time machine.
The combat! Oh, the combat! It's fluid, brutal, and incredibly satisfying. Whether you're slicing through enemies with a katana or disappearing into the shadows, every encounter is exhilarating. The two different playstyles are amazing, and so fun to master.
The story is a masterpiece. It's filled with intrigue, emotion, and genuine historical weight. I was completely invested from beginning to end.
The level of customization is insane. Every weapon, every piece of armor, every skill can be tailored to your playstyle. You can create truly unique characters and experiences.
The sound design. From the clanging of steel to the rustling of leaves, every sound is perfectly crafted to immerse you in the world.
The sheer amount of content. Exploration, side quests, hidden secrets... this game will keep you busy for hundreds of hours.
Overall, Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't just a game; it's an experience. It's a love letter to feudal Japan, a masterclass in game design, and a testament to the power of immersive storytelling.

Anyone playing yasuke is going to play 2x as long as just running in and assassinating everyone 

Ok I was a bit wrong. Though the story still sucks it does pick up pace and the voice acting isnt awful at least. Also stealth has improved a lot no more bugs (probably was buggy cause i explored a little too early. The combat does improve its not so unfair anymore and I think this could've been to progress halt the beggining. I think its pretty fun but I know im a bit biased because I love the og and stealth also the combat is more of origins than odessey now. Not so many spongey shit and armor weapon system is definately improved

I've played ac for the story and it being fun. Now I've played the recent ones because of the athmosphere, liking history and liking the basic mechanics of being an assassin. Now I can confidently say everything is removed except for a super basic stealth system. 

- Story
The story is boring and borderline unfinished/made in a week. The voice acting is actually so bad in english (dont know about the japanese). The only character that doesn't make me roll my eyes or laugh for being so bad is the dad and the black samurai. 
Story is such a basic revenge plot and does not even make sense. Why are you keep having flashbacks and not playing through the first parts as the tutorial? It makes no sense and i hate it. Nothing about anything is explained, what are the Iga - I guess they are real Assassins with the creed and everything but I don't know why we don't know. I don't understand why the poachers was so angry and mean towards us because I know NOTHING about my family or village. I hate it. Being forced into open world travel to be able to understand the story is so stupid. Because my character naoimi (dont even remember anyones name theyare so forgetable) knows what she is because I know that in a future flashback she will be told by her Chihue and that in the flashbacks she dont know the eagle vision or fall but then in the open world she does. It's so stupid why would you ever make this as a premise. I feel like this is yet another ac where you are not even an assassin you are just a person that lives in the world of assassins creed and I hate it! Everyone is a nothing character with some of the worst voice acting in a AAA game. 
- Athmosphere
It feels like I am in a historical anime. Like who decided that the music should be rock? THAT IS INSANE! All i see is attempts at making the humanly possible most safe decisions ever. There is nothing new about this game. Every sound is so generic, music is just noise to me, nothing about this is good. Archetecture does not even make sense. When you attack the first target you see a big ass castle tower thingy but you attack around a base with just walls and unfinished buildings (like this game, ironically nothing inside, just polished outside)

- Stealth and Combat
The stealth is stupid, bugged and does not work as it should in another game. Enemies see you when you stand on roofs, and how am i supposed to hide there? When you are trying to isolate an enemy but waiting for another one to move they are stuck in the beggining of an animation. When you whistle they are alerted and block you. Is this serious? Is this game just normal attacking? Not even being a fking assassin at all?? At least in the other games you didn't have to fight the enemies for 5 hours each. The blocking is so bad aswell. You either block waaaay to early or late because blue attacks have a million attacks after eachother and normal ones are so fast that you have to be ready and therefore press it to early or not ready and press it too late. Because every enemy has all red attacks you dont expect a normal one and when you do expect a blockable attack you dont realise it is a chain with 5 combos. Also the targeting system is godawful. It is like a soulslike boss battle because you only see yourself because the camera zooms in on you and that makes you not able to see when fighting a lot but without targeting you would not be able to dodge/block anything because again they are way to fast or unexpected. 

Everything about this game seems so uninspired and I think I am never buying this franchise again. Only reason I did, Also on that note I bought this KNOWING IT WOULD BE BAD BUT NOT FKING HORRIBLE. Only reason i did buy this was because no other games are coming out right now and Im waiting for the hardcore in kcd2. Comparing this game against KCD2 is honestly not even fair - for ac shadows i mean. They are so fundamentally different in how they feel and play its so sad. The gaming industry is dying and Indie games with a lot less budget is doing everything better than bigger budget with bigger teams games and its honestly so depressing. Not that its bad big companies are worse because yay indies but also this is now the industry standard of making sh!t games and now when a good game is out its an anomaly. Its the same thing about movies. This seems to be the industry that we are moving towards everywhere, in tech, in games, in movies, in politics, in economics everywhere sh!t is always bigger and costs more. Everything about the internet is worse with ai and big platforms are only degressing. I am so worried and it makes me sad about the future that not only me but my children one day will have to bare. Imagine how bad games will be in the future when we are only now coming at the stop for creativity and it somehow still the industry standard. Why would anyone have to try. just copy the other game and give polish to the graphics, implement a few gimmicks and dont even quality control the stories.

191175135,english,"Shadows is a real mixed bag for me. As with every AC title, Ubisoft has increased on the visual spectacle that each game is and Shadows is no exception. The game is beyond beautiful, it's a visual treat for the eyes to see, the world that they have created for you to run around and do things in is an easy 10/10. I especially love the weather and the seasons and how it effects the map, Since the heady days of AC3 you've never really had to take the weather into consideration when you go about and do things, which I think is a really nice re-addition. I do enjoy the sort of mini-base building aspect, and building up my own group of misfits. It really reminds me of AC:Brotherhood, where you build up your group with Ezio, although I wish they’d taken the Valhalla system and upgraded that, rather that the odd rts-style road they went down. I absolutely will say I approve of the pet-stroking simulator that started in Valhalla and continued into Mirage and now Shadows. I gets to pets all the kitties and doggos.

The Main story is about par for the course with AC titles, I found it a fairly enjoyable romp, but it's not going to win any awards for best story of the year, and the writing struggles in a few areas. After Odyssey, Valhalla and Mirage it's so strange seeing such a massive decrease in the voice acting, it really detracts from the overall experience of the main story. Naoe is easily my favorite of the duo, both for her story-line and how she plays, I'm playing a game where stealth is its main selling point, so playing an armored “samurai” is kind of counter-intuitive so outside of the parts the game forced me to playing as Yasuke I played 100% as Naoe, and honestly I’m not sure why they bothered including a second protagonist in Shadows, especially one that I don’t think should be working with Naoe after the events of the first hour of the game. She should have swung the sword down. Plus, I had been playing Naoe for over 30 hours before I got Yasuke so I was pretty settled in with playing just as the one character, rather than learn another one. That said, the stealth in Shadows is the best the AC-games have been in terms of mechanics and how you can play with the world around you while stealthing about, it’s a real treat in that regard, though the parkour system is still as mid as ever, peaking in Unity and never quite managing to find its feet again. I am also happy that we’re back dealing with the Templar Order. I have enjoyed the past few AC games where it’s been the Hidden Ones vs the Order of the Ancients, but I am happy to be going forward enough in the timeline to being Assassin’s vs Templars again. While I’m happy the Templars get a little time to shine, and even reference a little of the Ezio games, it’s a shame the Assassins are more of a dead remnant. After Mirage I was hoping we’d be back on track to sticking with the Assassins once again, the series is called Assassin’s Creed after all, but sadly it doesn’t seem to be the case. Honestly, I would have enjoyed instead playing the game as Alvaro Catarribera and his building of the Ikki and battling the Templars, rather than what we got in the end, but oh well.

The stuff I didn’t like, the modern day/animus stuff is as bland and boring as ever, still without a doubt the worst part of AC. They removed a fair few quality of life features, no more auto-horse gps, no more pull out a torch, having to unlock a specific npc to use transmogs rather than being able to do it from the get-go, there is no way to change the time of day like the past 3 titles. Viewpoints no longer scout out a nice chunk of the nearby area, they give you about as much as walking there yourself clears, so un-fogging the entire map is now an extreme chore. I don’t like how restrictive some assassination missions are, locking you in a small area with animus walls, preventing you from going after a target how you’d like too, instead railroading you down a set path. In combat there are also these weird sin-city type flashes when you’re doing certain abilities, your screen goes black and then a red flash of blood appears on it. It’s so bizarre in an AC game of all things, honestly at first I thought I was suffering some graphical errors it was so jarring to see. During some cutscenes, they decide to play odd music. Not like, ye olde japanese music that fits, no it’s like, anime style music you expect to see during an anime boss fight. Like, what in the fresh hell is that all about Ubi? There’s a lot more I didn’t really like, but frankly I don’t have enough characters in this review to go over all my issues. But as a final special mention, why did you take my bird, Ubisoft? :(

Frankly, I tossed and turned on what to rate Shadows. I am more in the middle, so a thumbs up and thumbs down really doesn't feel like it properly states what I think of this game, in the end I have gone with a thumbs down. The game has a lot going for it but Shadows in terms of gameplay is a real downgrade from Mirage and Valhalla, and I don't think this game is the direction the AC franchise, a franchise I have played every single game from to date, should have gone in. Or at least, if Shadows had to exist, they should have gone with their initial concept for the game that got leaked, not the re-written version. After visiting Egypt, Japan has been high up in AC fans locations to visit in the mainline games, and.. they really fumbled the bag on this one. Ubi have done a stellar job in the past with getting the game setting just right and respecting the cultures we visit, I mean you just need to play the most recent game of Mirage to see that, but they've dropped the ball on this one, big time. If Ubisoft survives 2025, I really hope they will remember what made AC great and return to it, not double down this nonsense.",False,0,0,1742932306,76561198021009862,7343

191175057,english,"This game requires a minor graphical fix, as some textures distort and move in strange shapes, which is quite amusing. This is one of the main issues I’ve encountered. My GPU is functioning well, but the game needs additional updates, particularly to improve the traditional Japanese art and architecture, which do not look very good. Additionally, the NPCs appear to be mere copies of one another, which detracts from the overall experience. The game fails to capture the essence of old Japan.

191174850,english,"Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a disaster. Ubisoft has once again proven that they have no idea how to make a game about assassins, instead shoving another empty open world at us, packed with pointless content and clunky gameplay.

Let's start with the main issue—stealth is dead. Completely. Stealth mechanics in this game boil down to sit in the bushes and wait, while enemy AI is stuck in 2010. They are dumb, blind, yet somehow always know exactly where you are when combat begins. Oh yeah, the combat... if you can even call it that. The hits feel like swinging foam bats, and enemies either drop in one hit or turn into bullet sponges, soaking up damage for ten minutes like MMORPG bosses.

The story? Not even worth talking about. It’s another uninspired mess that does nothing to explore the setting and doesn't feel like part of the series at all. Instead of a deep narrative about assassins and Templars, we get a cliché-ridden drama with a cast of forgettable, lifeless characters.

And now, the worst part the map. It’s massive, empty, and filled with 500 meaningless activities that boil down to fetch quests or ""clear out an enemy camp."" That already sounds boring, but imagine actually playing it! I don’t know what Ubisoft was thinking, but their living Japan feels more like a soulless checklist simulator than an immersive world.

All in all, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is yet another nail in the coffin of the franchise. Ubisoft has completely turned it into a lifeless, mass-produced cash grab that might only appeal to those who have never played the older games.

191174210,english,"I don't usually write game reviews, but Assassin's Creed Shadows is worth it. Ubisoft gets a lot of flak for making similar games and pushing microtransactions – and to be fair, that's a common problem with game companies. But the Assassin's Creed series has always been a big deal. I’ve played every single game, even the 2D ones, and while Assassin's Creed Odyssey was my favorite, Shadows is even better.

The two main characters in Shadows are awesome. You can easily switch between them and play as either a powerful fighter or a stealthy shinobi. This is way better than Odyssey, where you had to really focus on one style (assassin, hunter, or warrior) to be effective. Here, each character has their own strengths, so you can play how you want without needing to switch to different loadouts (though you still can).

Shadows' setting is amazing. Japan is beautiful, with super detailed buildings, stunning lakes, peaceful temples, and gorgeous forests. The game world looks incredible. I wasn’t a big fan of one of the ally characters (just my opinion), but that’s a small issue in an otherwise great game.

Everyone will compare this to Ghost of Tsushima, but they're different games. Assassin's Creed Shadows is fantastic and deserves its place in this awesome series. Like any series, some entries are weaker; for me, Valhalla was a bit boring for a Viking game and needed more action. On the other hand, Shadows looks fantastic.

I recommend doing this if you are finding it difficult on your keyboard to reach the keys needed to play the game well. Stealth games are my favorite and I am enjoying the stealth aspects to this game. The crawling option is fun to incorporate in different ways. I would recommend this game but keep in mind that it can take many hours of play to get a flow and understanding of how to best utilize the game mechanics.

This is the first AC game built for the PS5 system (Mirage was a cross gen) meaning there are so much more room for them play around and *innovate* and so they did. 

The game's lighting looks good (looks like dogshit sometimes too), there are seasons and weather changing the landscape and the npcs actually wear clothes appropriate to the season (except some wearing the same shit every seasons), there are a lot of stuff you can destroy just by rolling or swing your sword around, you can also collect the codex to learn about the real history and culture of Japan which is actually very cool. Everything combine makes the world feels very alive and interactive.

While the world feels really good, the story is a snore fest and the gameplay can be really janky at times, facial animation is a fucking joke everyone is ugly as hell and the voice acting is abysmal dogshit, the horse is a fat fucking cunt who doesn't listen to whatever you tell it to do and it constantly gets stuck.

剧情和沉浸感形制方面，
对白的违和感在第一章早期结束后明显降低，翻译质量也有明显改善。
开篇的故事结束之后本地化质量有飞跃式的上升。
抛开第一章大概率是强行塞入的凝视感极强的演出（第一章前半简直是游戏体验的洼地）中东施效颦的刻意和做作的内容之后。
你会发现除去少部分要素的混同之外UBI确实做了大量功课。

如主线人物和重要直线角色千利休，和弥助正式登场后的流程安土城前情提要章节（虽然有些过于提高弥助的地位），宁宁（非常加分）与阿市与上泉信纲着三个角色，重视角色存在感却相对自然的塑造法和运镜，确实是熟悉的讲述法。比起Odyssey里满地神经病乱跑的古希腊来讲这次日本的舞台中角色普遍地合理且真实了很多。

被很多人贬低的织田信长的人物在游戏中的塑造其实相当成功，
实际游玩过程中的形象其实比只露了个骑马头盔脸的PV中好很多，威严智慧与残暴并存的枭雄形象表现充分，也没有PV中大家所抨击的猥琐感。

四季的变化和环境的互动相当优秀，
下血本打造的日本田园景致（相比真实的地貌更加入了颜色的填充和相对合理的植被变化）非常优秀。

更重要的是从第二章开始双主角游戏风格迥然不同，可以说是真正意义上的双主角路线。

评价未完。



=========================
以下是最初序章体验的差评
老实说我不太介意黑人武士斩杀日本平民的问题。
信野和仁王也早已经让我习惯了弥助在游戏中的作为一个强力武士的存在。
游戏还特地做了个日语葡语交融的文化沉浸模式。
但是我仍然不得不给差评。

开篇弥助和信长的互动虽然没什么亮点但至少相对合理，人物对话台词也相对正常。
但游戏的沉浸感在奈緒江（なおえ）登场的那一刻起就变成了笑话。
相比之下各个舆论区吵得飞起的弥助的武士伪史和日本人对gaijin斩杀日本人的抱怨，精日们大呼不可破坏神社等问题只能算得上是鸡毛蒜皮。


最重要的问题：影作为系列首部东亚主题的正作其编剧和总设计师，乃至于演出人员对日本文化这东西完全是一无所知。
欧美也有很多将日本形象塑造得较为有说服力得作品，比如高堡奇人，虽然启用了大量华裔演员演绎日本人，口音和现实日本脱节，但是剧组对于昭和时期的日本社会氛围的把握至少有个合格的水平。

相比之下AC影全篇巨量的常识错误, 生活用语错误，还有设计得莫名其妙前言不搭后语违和感极强的伪古日文台词，让人让人觉得这文本大概是将欧洲作者写的剧本直接用翻译工具翻成了日文而没有经过任何润色。
对日本剑戟片和昭和时代演歌的拙劣且完全踩空重点的东施效颦让演出变得尴尬无比。
当藤林死亡那刻莫名其妙的演歌倾情演出，设计风格尴尬得让人扣脚的面具众出现在眼前时，那一幕我真的是捏着鼻子看下去的。
——他们甚至懒得找一个靠谱的本土日本人当作顾问来监制这一整个游戏的演出效果。
唯一人保存了一点纯正日本味的就是那几位敬业的CV笑

191170014,english,"I think the game is solid,

Has a great setting and world. The missions are similar to what was in AC Valhalla where each ""sector"" of the map has a set of missions but less obvious. I like what they did with the objectives, however can become boring/repetitive. Hideout is actually a great innovation. The epilogue is bit rough, with the constant time skips but when u get past that the game is okay. It is also interesting innovation where you can choose which character to play and their respective strength/weaknesses, whereas in Syndicate they were almost equal just different abilities.

On the other hand a lot of character lack meaningful depth, the content is limited and you do not learn about them like you would in the previous games. Also there is a lack of side characters and content to them. You do get some but they are not really a companions that you interact regularly but appear only in certain missions. I personally have not experienced any bugs unless u really try to find them.

Would give it a try  when discounted.

There are plenty of great games that have bizarre bugs, but as a SW engineer, I think the expectation that these games be flawless to justify their massive budgets, is truly bizarre. 

I've worked for companies that spend 100s of millions of dollars to create some of the most janky/bug-ridden applications you've ever seen.

I've spent around 30 hours in the game so far, and I’m still nowhere near the end—which, for me, is perfect. I’ve always loved long, engaging stories, and I might have a bit too much fun getting sidetracked thanks to the breathtakingly beautiful landscapes of Feudal Japan.
The characters are a significant highlight. Naoe, with her small and adorable demeanour, is incredibly agile, gracefully weaving through enemies with precision and speed. However, her agility comes at a cost—she’s fragile and can’t take hits like Yasuke. Yasuke, on the other hand, is a powerhouse—a true tank on the battlefield. His resilience and strength allow him to absorb damage and protect his allies, balancing out Naoe’s fragility. Despite his intimidating appearance, Yasuke is a surprisingly chill and likeable samurai. Their contrasting personalities and combat styles complement each other beautifully, adding depth to both the narrative and gameplay.
Of course, no game is without its flaws—there are still a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing that detracts significantly from the overall experience.
In my opinion, AC Shadows is a solid 9/10. It’s an incredible journey that I’d wholeheartedly recommend. Even knowing I'm not nearly close to completing the game :)

I fell off the series after Black Flag and haven't had any interest since, so I assumed that this one wouldn't be for me either, but I kept hearing good things and decided to pick it up on a whim.

The game is big, but not too big, and the side content is fun. I often find myself accidentally spending a few hours exploring and clearing castles when I had intended to do a story mission just because I'm having a good time. The story is fairly straightforward (at least as far as I've gotten) but well executed. I'm on board with Naoe's motivations and I'm eager for Yasuke to get back into the mix and see how their conflicting viewpoints interact. 

Some people have complained about the characters feeling flat but I find them charming and well written, with clear motivations and personalities. Maybe people are just thrown off by the restrained and formal way people speak to each other in this time period? Or maybe it's the English voice acting.

191161314,english,"[table][th] Review by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34633003-Gaming-Masterpieces/lists/] Gaming Masterpieces [/url]  - The greatest games of all time on Steam.
[/th][/table]

Is this game a masterpiece? Yes, even if some ppl dislike it and want to tell you that a cheap memegame is better than this AAA-release. 

Japan is at a crossroads. Foreign powers are reaching for influence and the old order is beginning to totter. But the real threat lurks in the shadows: a secret league is secretly pulling the strings to realize its own plans. It's up to us to stop them. Or rather: on Yasuke and Naoe. Two fates, two paths. Yasuke, the legendary African samurai, serves Oda Nobunaga with unwavering loyalty. Naoe, a shinobi from Iga, fights for the freedom of her homeland. Opposites that are actually mutually exclusive - and yet this time they are inextricably linked. First things first: Assassin's Creed Shadows creates a fascinating backdrop, but the actual story? It falls short of its potential. Admittedly, previous installments in the series were no masterpieces of storytelling, but at least they offered excitement and motivation to delve deeper into their world. Shadows, on the other hand, suffers from its predictability. Surprising twists and turns? Hardly any. Captivating arcs of suspense? Not at all. The game weaves a web of intrigue and mystery, but it tears before it can unfold. The biggest problem? The often pale antagonists, whose identity is often obvious after just a few missions. Where earlier parts scored points with cleverly working their way up in enemy organizations, Shadows lacks any narrative structure. The supporting characters also remain colorless - they have stories, but hardly any weight. The personal careers of Yasuke and Naoe are somewhat more convincing. Sure, they too have some narrative weaknesses, but it's still fun to follow their path to becoming an honorable samurai or a deadly shinobi. Their motivations are clear, their decisions often understandable - but that's not enough to make for an epic narrative overall. After around 30 hours, when the credits finally rolled, I was still waiting for the story to pick up pace. But that didn't happen. All that remains is a meagre feeling - and the question: That's it now?

So, enough complaining - now it gets better, I promise! Because the real strength of the game lies in its gameplay. Thanks to the two playable protagonists, we (for the most part) have the choice of how we want to play. Samurai or shinobi? You have to play both - sometimes directly and with brute force, sometimes stealthily and with deadly precision. Basically, the combat system remains rather simple. There are light and heavy attacks that can be charged up into powerful stance attacks by holding them for longer - ideal for breaking through enemy blocks and exposing weak points. There are also dodge and block mechanics, which are sometimes more or less in demand depending on the opponent. Some enemies require a tactical approach, but often simply hitting them is enough - at least if you're playing our samurai. Yasuke is not an assassin in the classic sense. He is a samurai - big, strong, commanding respect. Sneak? Deception? Not his style. Instead, he plows through hordes of enemies like a walking storm. Locked gates? No problem - just run in and keep going. His fighting style is powerful and brutal, his weapons - including oukatana, naginata, kanabou, bow and teppou - offer plenty of variety and are further enhanced by individual skill trees with active and passive abilities. But those who prefer to operate from the shadows will have little fun with Yasuke. Fortunately, there's also Naoe.

With Naoe, you get the classic, popular Assassin's Creed experience - and perhaps even better than ever before. She stays in the shadows, sneaking silently through enemy camps and eliminating her targets with deadly precision. Her hidden blade is her most loyal companion, but when necessary she also uses her other weapons: katana, tanto and kusarigama. Sneaking and climbing are her favorites, and she maneuvers around her opponents with the agility of a weasel. Smoke bombs, kunai and other gadgets equip her for any situation. However, her vulnerability becomes apparent in open combat: she can hold her own against two or three opponents, but if the whole camp is alerted, the only option is often to flee. Fortunately, she is well prepared for this - with parkour skills and a grappling hook, with which she can escape at lightning speed over roofs, trees and walls. The new controls with two separate buttons for ascending and descending make climbing smoother than ever.

But you have to hand it to Assassin's Creed Shadows: There is certainly no shortage of things to do here. From the main missions to simple side tasks such as silently sneaking up on an animal to paint it - there's a bit of everything here. But let's start with the main quests. Despite the strong gameplay, Shadows does not reach its full potential in the main missions. Many missions feel too repetitive: we infiltrate enemy camps, take out targets, steal documents or collect items. Mechanically, this works well and there are some highlights - such as a mission in which Naoe learns the art of the tea ceremony. However, such creative moments unfortunately remain the exception as a rule. The Japanese setting in particular, with all its cultural peculiarities, would have offered much more variety. The side quests are better. Some of them even offer exciting challenges. For example, we hunt dangerous shinobi, who are feared by humans in various ways, or challenge our master's former students to a duel with Yasuke. There are also plenty of collecting tasks - such as tracking down lost scrolls in temples to improve the skill tree. But in the end, much of this remains pure occupational therapy, as these activities are sometimes too repetitive.

What Shadows does masterfully, however, is its game world. Japan has rarely been depicted so impressively. Lively towns, small villages, dense forests, endless fields, rugged mountains - every panorama is an invitation to marvel. And then there are the changing seasons: Sometimes the country shines in the lush green of summer, sometimes it lies hidden in a gentle blanket of snow. A sight that always tempts you to pause for a moment - and to press the screenshot button.

[u][b] Conclusion:[/b][/u]
Naoe may prefer to hide from her opponents - but Assassin's Creed Shadows, with its unused Japanese scenario, certainly doesn't have to hide in the shadows from the current competition (and its own predecessors). For me is one of the most beautiful and also playfully best parts of the long-running series.",True,0,13,1742920037,76561198019466684,2430

So I'm all the more pleased that Shadows is a masterpiece for me personally. The story, as in all ACs, is certainly no Baldur's Gate 3 or Heavy Rain, but it's perfectly fine for what Assassin's Creed represents.

The world is beautifully designed, the new gameplay mechanics are great and the fact that you now have 2 such different characters to choose from is a big plus for me.

If you're looking for a historically accurate game, you're definitely in the wrong place, but you're also in the wrong place in the whole AC series. I'm looking at you Odysee, with your cyberpunk Atlantis and the immortality stick.

This is my favorite Assassin's Creed since Unity. It's also the closest in the series' identity since then. I speak with fair confidence in that, as someone that has played the series since its inception back in 2007. It still has fragments of the RPG formula- too many, still, for my liking- but this is a more successful hybrid of structure and root than anything we've had in the last ten years. 

In contrast to Valhalla, with battered shields and war cries; in contrast to Odyssey, with sunkissed beaches and mercenaries; in contrast still to Origins, which started us down this overwrought road, Shadows is a reflective, somber entry in the series. There are vast stretches of space in the game world, yes, but rather than being stuffed with content and icons, I instead found it a welcome, sweet respite between bouts of stealth and combat. Its story, too- which, in regards to Naoe's side, I still find utterly compelling- does not reach the heights of the Ezio trilogy, or even the Kenway games, but it feels much, much more human and down to earth than anything since Black Flag. 

There are faults. I will not defend this game as a perfect isle undeserving of criticism. Parkour is imprecise, lacking polish and design decisions that could easily prop it up by kilometers. Leveling feels unsatisfying, without any particular depth beyond a number's arbitrary increase. While I find the relaxed pace of the map inviting, I freely admit it is still way, way, way too big, in Ubisoft's tried-and-true mantra of making too much instead of just the right amount. I genuinely fail to grasp why Yasuke is a protagonist; in so far as I've gotten, he feels entirely inconsequential. 

Yet, these flaws are not nearly enough to be deserving of the scorn I see repeated for Shadows ad nauseam online. I understand the want to hate Ubisoft, and if anything, I do hope that the pressure they're under pushes them out of the trough they've been fond of feeding in for far too long, but people are too eager to heap hatred upon something without reason. If you've wanted a stealth-focused Assassin's Creed, like I have, I entreat you to give this a try. Of all things, it reminds me of classic Splinter Cell at times, which is a comparison I'd given up on making decades ago. If you want to relish in the beauty of a truly spectacular landscape, with showers of flower petals and windswept snow, Shadows is worth it for the eye candy alone. If you want a really good story, then I honestly think you'll find one here, though I would recommend playing it in the 'immersive mode' with Japanese dub. 

I loathe the continued sanding down of nuance in online discussion, and the way individual complaints can launch into a fever when caught by virality. More than anything in the above sentences, I ask you to try things that people seem so set on hating, before following suit yourself. If you try it and dislike it, for whatever reason, then that's just as within reason as my fondness, but temper yourself with firsthand experience first.

191154381,english,"I love and hate this game equally at the same time.

I can get behind a kind of boring story line no problem. It doesn't always have to be groundbreaking or reinventing the wheel. A revenge plot is something I can get behind as someone who hasn't played a major AC game since Unity. Its in just about everything else that I found to be a problem.

I constantly find myself out smarting the game. Want to use your grapple hook on that? Can't. Want to climb that? For some reason.. also can't. You'd think a parkour expert would know how to climb a spiked fence. Speaking of, the parkour feels so jank still. It's so clearly on rails and the game picks up the character and moves them there rather than it feeling like an authentic jump. It's so strange because you have these crazy flip animations and at the same time the game carries you making you feel weightless. It's kind of like how when you used to pet dogs in old games they would slide you into the right pre-animation positions. By 2025 you'd think they would know how to do that better now. Same old Ubisoft I guesss.

Speaking about same old Ubisoft.. micro transactions? Are you fr right now? You gotta be busting my balls here. I paid 70 dollars for this and you want me to pay MORE? When the game itself doesn't even deserve 70 dollars anyway?? Hell no. Get out of my face lmao.

The graphics in this game are truly something else. They *can* be gorgeous. I genuinely mean that. Jaw dropping. That comes at a hefty cost though.. and that cost is locked 30fps even with an rtx 4080 and A LOT of loading screens. Like an ungodly amount of them. Kill a guy -> loading screen -> wait ten seconds -> cut scene for five minutes. Sometimes you won't even go to the fade to black screen the game will just rip you out, put you in that free run white room, and then go back to fade to black, load some more, and then FINALLY a cut scene. Takes me right out of the immersion that I was actually finding myself invested in. Shame.

Truthfully, go play Ghost of Tsushima. The game is leagues better (and cheaper). This game is *fine* I guess. It's nothing special so far and I doubt you'd get the same emotions that GoT gave you. So if you're looking to get that high here you won't get it. If you're looking to fill that void until Yotei comes out then maybe you will I dunno.

All in all wait for a sale. If they had spent maybe another four months on the game ironing out bugs from A.I, letting me climb properly, redoing some facial animations during the gorgeous cut scenes, and fixing the ""on rails"" parkour then I'd say you got your moneys worth even with the horsecrap micro transactions. Until then wait for at least 40% off but preferably 50%.

Could've been an all time great and despite how much I genuinely enjoy this game it constantly reminds me that it is, unfortunately, not.

Lastly, anyone who complains about Yasuke being black is honestly a little bitch. Although you don't spend much time with him in the first two hours what you did see was very interesting and I got to play more of his story line. Very cool.

The things I dont like, When you run through hills and bushes its insane and its hard to see your character when you are surrounded by bush shrubs. if your trying to go up a side of a cliff its hard cause you can not see the character and the surroundings so you dont know if there is something you can grab on or not.
some of the animations can be weird at times. The skills are okay but it could be better. Personally not a fan of the loot system that gear just drops everywhere like diablo style ""maybe im just being to hard on it but time will tell.""

Assassin's Creed Shadows here we are the truth is I can't understand why they criticize it as such a bad game and I will explain why. 
Positives first.

Story so far is ok  story is definitely not as bad as they characterize it but that may change because I am still at the beginning of the story.

Graphics are very nice in general  landscape world etc and I really liked that you change seasons and each season changes its world too another thing that I really liked  how things in the world can be destroyed. 
Stealth is much improved from previous assassins with some new features (and yes there is a setting where you can do stealth like the old assassins and ignore the level when you kill someone with the hidden blade like the old assassins). 

Let's go to the negatives of the game. 

AI would like some improvements it is not and the best we have seen I hope with the updates this will change and improve  Voice-overs and some bugs also .The movements when we see the cinematic how you move their mouth as they speak is not the most realistic we have seen .. we are in 2025. the voices of the game are not that nice I would prefer more liveliness when they speak and how they express emotions when they say something because what we see is inexpressible. 

Micro transactions in a single-player game with 70 Dollar price tag, why? come on they don't force you but still i know we had in previous also assassins creed games.AND PLEASE FIX PHOTO MODE ON ULTRA WIDE MONITOR ASAP

these are what I have found so far maybe in the process I will see other things that are negative or some positive will show. 

One more thing I would like to say regarding the romance of the game and they negative  badly is because you can go with the same gender but the game does not force you guys to go with the same gender  This thing is from assassin odyssey where you can as a man go with both genders the same equivalent with women since it does not force me to go with the same gender and you have the choice to go with a woman I do not find it bad since it gives me the choice to go with a woman everything is good.

But 100% this one is better than Assassin's Creed Valhalla and maybe also from mirage

Greek Review:
Assassin’s Creed Shadows εδώ είμαστε  η αλήθεια ειναι δεν μπορώ  να καταλάβω γιατί το κατακρίνουν  τόσο κακό παιχνίδι και θα σας εξηγήσω  γιατί. 

Τα θετικά του πρώτα

 Η ιστορία του μέχρι στιγμής  είναι οκ  σίγουρα όχι τόσο χάλια η ιστορία του όπως το χαρακτηριζουνε άλλα αυτό ίσως αλλάξει γιατί είμαι ακόμα στην αρχή ιστορίας. 

τα γραφικά του ειναι πολυ ωραία  γενικά το τοπίο  του ο κόσμος του και πολύ μ άρεσε που αλλάζεις εποχές  και κάθε εποχή  αλλάζει και ο κόσμος του ενα αλλο που μ αρεσε πολυ κιολας ειναι πως καταστρεφωνται τα πραγματα στον κοσμο. το stealth  του ειναι πολυ βελτιωμένο  από τα  προηγούμενα  assassin με κάποια νέα χαρακτηριστικά (και ναι υπάρχει ρύθμιση  που μπορείς να κάνεις το stealth όπως τα παλιά assassin και να αγνοεί  το level όταν σκοτώνεις  κάποιον με το hidden blade όπως τα παλιά assassin). 

 Πάμε στα αρνητικά  του παιχνιδιού.

 Το AI του θα ήθελε κάποιες βελτιώσεις δεν είναι και το καλύτερο που έχουμε δει ελπίζω με τις ενημερώσεις αυτό να αλλάξει και να βελτιώσει τα Voice-overs και μερικά σφάλματα(Bugs του παχνιδιου) επίσης. οι κινήσεις  όταν βλέπουμε  τα cinematic  το πως κινείτε  το στόμα  του όπως μιλάνε  δεν είναι και ότι πιο  ρεαλιστικό  έχουμε δει ..είμαστε στο 2025. η φωνές του παιχνιδιού  δεν είναι και τόσο ωραίες  θα προτιμούσα  περισσότεροι  ζωντάνια όταν μιλάνε  και πως εκφράζουν  τα συναισθήματα  όταν λένε κάτι γιατί αυτό που βλέπουμε είναι ανέκφραστο. 

Αυτα βρήκα μέχρι στιγμής  ίσως στην πορεία να δω και άλλα πράγματα που είναι αρνητικά η κάποια θετικά θα δείξει.  

Μικρο-συναλλαγές σε ένα single-player παιχνίδι  με τιμή 70 δολαρίων, γιατί; δεν σε αναγκάζουν, αλλά  ξέρω ότι είχαμε και σε προηγούμενα παιχνίδια assassins creed Μικρο-συναλλαγές.ΚΑΙ ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΩ ΔΙΟΡΘΩΣΤΕ ΤΗ ΛΕΙΤΟΥΡΓΙΑ ΦΩΤΟΓΡΑΦΙΑΣ ΣΤΗΝ ULTRA WIDE ΟΘΟΝΗ TO ΣΥΝΤΟΜΟΤΕΡΟ

ένα ακόμα που θα ήθελα  να πω όσο αφορά  το romance του παιχνιδιού και το κράζουν  κάκιστα  είναι επειδή  μπορείς να πας με το ίδιο  φύλο άλλα δεν σε αναγκάζει  το παιχνίδι  παιδιά να πάτε δε και καλά με το ίδιο φύλο  αυτό υπάρχει  από το assassin  odyssey  που μπορείς σαν άντρας να πας και με τα δύο φυλα το ίδιο αντίστοιχο  και με τις γυναίκες  από την στιγμή που δεν με αναγκάζει  να πάω δε και καλά με το ίδιο φύλο  και έχεις επιλογή  να πας με γυναίκα  δεν το βρίσκω  κακό  από την στιγμή που μ δινει την επιλογή  να πάω με γυναίκα είναι όλα καλα.

Αλλά 100% αυτό είναι καλύτερο από το Assassin's Creed Valhalla και ίσως και από το mirage.

This time around, it takes us to feudal Japan which is full of beautiful open world areas, but also, filled with chaos and bloodshed.

As someone who has played every single AC game to date, on multiple platforms and to 100% completion (multiple times), I consider myself a die hard fan of the AC series!!

⚫You get to play as 2 main characters - Yasuke, the samurai and Naoe the shinobi assassin. I have seen lot's of hate over this but AC syndicate also done something similar with Jacob and Evie Frye which I adored. One an assassins to the bone, and the other, a mean brawler with a mouth that runs.
⚫The animations are fantastic. The execution animation are just... really well done. The blood, the dismemberment... its just really well done. Not only that, the parkour animations are cool. Jumping from rooftop to floor to roof e.t.c doing all the flips and little landing animations, these are wicked to have.
⚫As Naoe you can ""LIE down"" now... what? You can actually crawl on the floor to hide in ""short"" tall grass. I am unsure what I think about this one but it does help when you are stealthing.
⚫The stealth in the game is really really cool. You can jump in a shallow pond and pull out a little reed to breathe and hide in the water. You can find shadows all around you, go into one and it makes enemies harder to detect you. 
⚫The world is gorgeous. From the moment you start, able to explore, you are greeted with a run down temple that is surrounded by a beautiful forest with lush vibrant trees, goregeous coloured leaves falling from them... to so much more. I would say its postcard picturesque at times! Have a look: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3451799047
⚫Optimisation? So far, on my PC that is, I have had no issues at all. No crashing. Stuttering. Freezing, e.t.c. My FPS is also stable at around 80-100. I am also running at max settings so I could get more FPS potentially if I lower my settings.
⚫The main menu let's you choose all of the AC games starting with Odyssey 431 BCE, Origins 49 BCE, Mirage 861 CE, Valhalla 872 CE and finally Shadows 1579 CE. It's cool they are in order and you can launch the games from this page too which I thought was cool. The only thing missing... is all the other AC games. Look: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3451800255
⚫You get to build your own hideout from scratch. Place your own buildings, rotate them, decorate them and upgrade them when you get the materials. 
⚫YOU CAN ADOPT PETS FOR YOUR HIDEOUT BY PETTING THEM!!!

[h1][b] Cons [/b][/h1] 
⚫Ubisoft, please answer this - Why did you spend time on making an in-game item store with packs that cost £10-30? Shouldn't you guys have worked on the game more? Added in a ""in-game store"" later on after the game launched? This feels like pure greed on your half.
⚫The parkour is basic. If you are looking for ""UNITY"" parkour or better, Shadows is not an improvement. It replaces fluent parkour with animations like flipping. 
⚫The enemy AI are... abysmally stupid at times. As Naoe you can just lie on the floor and the enemy will not be able to hit you at all. They will swing but they cannot hit you. Nice coding here Ubisoft.
⚫Personally, I am not a fan of the soundtrack. At times it does not fit the game. Example - you are killing your first enemy, EVER as younger Naoe. Why does this ""rock-ish"" Japanese music play? She's literally got PTSD from killing her first enemy and you put that music there? 
⚫Not really a con but I want to mention this - as someone that purchased the collectors edition - why does the steelbook case have 2 disc slots and not one? Was I supposed to get a ""SOUNDTRACK"" disc? 
⚫So, while exploring and running around, I got a random message on my screen basically telling me not to climb on TORI gates... its a game... but yet we can murder, sell drugs, steal cars e.t.c without being told not to. Look yourself: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3451799452


[h1][b] Final Thoughts/My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
At the end of the day, AC Shadows is probably the best AC game we have had in a long time. Yes, it's better than Mirage, Valhalla, Origins because you can play as an ACTUAL assassin again. 

Shadows has been under fire for a lot of things since it's announcement and it doesn't deserve all this hate. It is an actual good game, albeit it had a few mishaps along the way.

The combat is good, the exploration is good, the game looks amazing, the stealth is good (unless you lie down), you get to build your own hideout and explore a massive feudal Japan... what more do you want? We have always craved an AC game set in Japan, haven't we? 

[h1][b] 8/10 - AC: Shadows is a game marred by toxicity and hatred, sadly, but none-the-less, a fantastic next instalment and a step up from its predecessor! [/b][/h1]",True,0,0,1742908509,76561198156021248,961

---

Few more hours later, I love the game still, but the usual lack of combat balance for minmaxers like me is showing up. I have made Yasuke so OP it's breaks my fun. If I can help it, I play Naoe and still - trying to not abuse those skills. I hope they would remove them at all, and make combat pure combo-manual skill based.

Also all the animus inserts break immersion slightly. I hope they will dissapear in the next installment forever.
But to be honest - combat is WAY better than it was in Odyssey and Origins, not to mention Valhalla where it sucked completely. Best Assassins Creed game in last decade easily.

191144247,english,"I think people are giving this game complaints for the sake of either venting their anger they have towards Ubisoft, the new AC style, or the triple A gaming space in general. Multiple things can be true at the same time.

Ubisoft is a shit company with shitty, anti-consumer practices.
The new AC formula works for some people and does not work for others. I like it here and in Origins, I hate it in Odyssey.
The triple A gaming industry is honestly dog shit right now. Every company is fucking up somewhere.
AND, Assassins Creed Shadows is a fun, well-made (but not perfect) game.

I do want to get one thing out of the way. As an actual historian specializing in Japanese history, this game gets a lot of history wrong, especially around Yasuke. But, that is where the complaints should be: in the historical accuracy. Those that argued there should not be a black man are simply denying the existence of Yasuke as an actual individual. They took creative liberties. And, if you complain about a woman being in the game, that is even stupider. Historians know women fought in feudal Japan. Why get angry at reality?

There are some parts in the game that are very copy-pastey. But, still, it is bad ass to run around stealth killing everyone (especially if you reactivate instant stealth kills in the settings.)

I truly enjoy the game. Though, I hope they release a performance patch because 30-40 frames on under-recommended hardware is a bit ridiculous in this day and age",True,0,0,1742904634,76561198001092941,632

Может она чему-то научится у лучших игр или придумает крутые механики для серии?
Мб юбики наконец-то сделают интересную боевую систему? 
Я повелся на волну хайпа, чтобы проверить это и был разочарован. Опять. Года идут, а воз и ныне там. 

Это та же рутинная зачистка аванпостов за награду в виде шмота +5% к статам. 
Юбисофт просто в рот eбали нас удивлять, им воще поxую.
Вы будете сечь челов катаной по 8-15 ударов из-за злоeбучей уровневой системы, это будет повторяться даже когда ваша разница будет не больше одного-двух уровней, что выглядит абсолютно бредово имея в руках настолько смертоносное оружие.

Я не понимаю зачем так цепляться за уровневую систему, уже которая часть игры с этой системой, зачем она нужна? Какую задачу она выполняет? Для чего нужно это сдерживание игрока, когда все наоборот стремятся к свободе выбора и вариативности прохождения. Пора бы уметь делать лаконично, а не в лоб.

Всё погружение в самурайские бои, их напряжение и выдержку сведено к минимуму из-за вот этого лупилова по забронированным челам, тот же Секиро показывает, как можно убивать челов в броне через подмышки и другие мясные места (исторический факт на секунду), наш герой этого не умеет хотя бы в виде награды за грамотное пэрри. (даже тупо сnиздить как у Секиро не захотели)

Против джаггернаутов есть только урон из стелса, который откусывает какую-то часть хп, но после этого нужно опять долбить броню, чтобы игрока пустило к полоске хп. 
Вот это долбилово по броне это настолько на отъебись сделано, без какой-либо идеи за собой, вместо того, чтобы дать какие нибудь спешл мувсеты, грамотные пэрри от входящего удара или комбо, которые нужно правильно ввести для убийства такого челика, менеджмент выносливости врага, нам просто предлагают долбить броню, пока она не отвалится. 
Это очень тупо и позорно выглядит на фоне игр 4-5 летней давности в этом же сеттинге.

Игра постоянно бросает пыль в глаза, делая вид, что у игрока есть свобода выбора и вариативность ситуаций.
У вас не получится отдохнуть от стелса, юбисофт очень не хотят, чтобы вы играли вне стелса, игра не умеет комбинировать разные состояния.
Даже в презентации геймплея, юбисофт стесняются показывать конфронтации вне стелса, где урон превращается в тыкву.

Буквально всё что про геймплей - это скам, чтобы бессовестно своровать ваше время.

191140679,english,"TLDR: This game is a mixed bag but still an overall good time.

I think this game has things that are absolutely incredible but also some that are mediocre at best. 

[b]The good:[/b] The stealth gameplay is great. I played on the hardest difficulty and it was fun throughout the whole game. Towards the end it did get a bit old but still the mechanics added greatly improve imersion and the AI is much improved. Yasukes combat is also fun and though there is some jank, it is considerably reduced compared to the previous RPG games in the series. The progression system was engaging although i wish there were more than 3 abilities per weapon. Constantly switching them kept it fresh. The graphics and atmosphere were absolutely stunning. The way the weather simulation works and how dynamic it is, is no short of a wonder to look at. The world is overall very beautiful. 

[b]The not so good:[/b] The story sucks. I'm just gonna say it. It really is not memorable at all. It starts off quite strong. I'd say the first act is quite well done. As soon as you get to act 2 everything just falls apart. We get the same structure as Valhalla but instead of ""secure alliance"" you get ""kill bad guy"". Like 12 times in a row. Granted much shorter than each of the Valhalla campains it is just as poorly done. I did not care at all about any of these people. They were not developed at all, they are so forgetable. I have the game fresh in my head and i could not name you a single one or tell you what they were about except maybe one. This structure DOES NOT WORK if you want to tell a good story. It also does not help that there are such few motioncapped cutscenes. The devs claimed to have a lot more than previous RPG games prior to release. That is absolutely FALSE. It has a few in the prologue, a few at the beginning of act 2, and a few in the end. I don't think they even exceed 1 hour if you were to make a collage of them. Because of that most of the characters feel robotic and lifeless. Origins was a larger game than this, and that had one of the best stories in the whole series and was FILLED with quality cutscenes, not this procedurally generated crap. Beyond this i think while the dual protagonists was a good idea on paper, the execution is so poor. The game makes you go through 3 menus to be able to switch and then you get a 10 second load screen. All the while there is a one button shortcut to get to the in game store. Are you fucking kidding me? Also doesn't help that there are stuff in enemy camps that only one character can interact with to get to certain chests. So you'd have to make your way out of the giant castle, sit through 30 seconds of time wasting to switch characters, go back to said place just to be able to loot it. Gimping each character wasn't going to be a major issue if switching characters wasn't such a headache but sadly it is. Lastly, the in game store...and especially the ""battle passes"". Battle passes in single player games? That is unacceptable. This is a fully priced game, not some F2P game that needs revenue to keep it going.

This review was long and it seemed more negative than positive but i did have an overall good time with the game. Mostly because of the gameplay and the beauty of the game. I don't necessarily want them to go back to the old style of the games in the series. I want them to tell great stories again, i want them to have memorable characters, that don't feel like robots. I want said stories to be about assassins. I don't want them to be a side activity as they were in the last few games, including this one.

The Combat is fun and challenging at the same time. Stealth with Naoe is very satisfying Yasuke feels completely different absolute powerhouse, but don't try stealth he will fail with his first step.  
Story looks to be interesting but not Blockbuster worthy, some really small side stories felt more interesting so far. 

Performance wise the game is really power hungry, don't expect high frame number with beautiful graphics. But once you have settings maxed out you see why it is so consuming. The world is absolutely breathtaking and made with much care.

Everything else is either bad or mediocre especially the parkour, horse riding and movement in general. It feels so clunky to try and navigate rooftops and high walls its like they didn't design them with parkour in mind and added it as an afterthought and the horses have some kind of brain damage. Even as Naoe you will find yourself in combat more than using stealth because the mechanics for it are ass and do not compliment the rest of the systems in the game and is only worth using if u enable instant assassinations in the menu. Base building was completely unnecessary and it a used to pad out game time by collecting resources for it. 

The story is a poorly told snoozefest and none of the characters are compelling despite there reasons for their actions and the paths they take the writers, directors and facial animators failed to make them come alive, especially the English voice acting, Japanese voice acting is better by far especially when it comes to the protagonists. Yasuke, regardless of how you feel about his inclusion in this game is the least of its problems. The whole animus thing is very lame and immersion breaking when you are constantly reminded you are playing a memory of an ancestor rather than trying to immerse yourself into this era and the story they are trying to tell. 

Micro-transactions in a single player game for the lobotomised whales who are too busy drooling on their credit card to realise they are wasting money.

In regards to performance its mostly okay apart from NVIDIAs frame gen becoming unavailable sometimes and sometimes not. One issue for me personally is that the sun will sometimes be overpowering and blind half the screen i think its a weather  systems thing since changing my settings didn't do anything, unless its a artistic choice then its a bad one.

Quests are varied, story is okay, graphics are gorgeous (also the environmental stuff like seasons and weather are insanely well executed and moody), sound design is equally as amazing, Japanese voice acting in superb, combat is okay and fluid enough though I wish there was more variety animations wise like the big weakspot hits especially always having the exact same repetitive attack, stealth is amazing (there's even a difficulty setting that makes it like the original games where assassinations were always a confirmed kill instead of having to rely on perks to kill bigger enemies or elites instead of just wounding) and I love the fact that on the harder stealth difficulty, enemies more realistically spot you instead of sticking to the old AC formula where their vertical field of view is quite narrow so you're almost always safe if you're on a rooftop.

Surprisingly the only bug I have encountered so far was one instance of an enemy briefly getting stuck inside a boulder but other than that, quite a polished game.

Performance is also pretty good, I have a dated 2080 but I can still play on a mix of medium and high settings just fine on 1440p with DLSS set to quality.

Fun fact, there's an in-game special currency (separate from the premium currency shop) you can complete weekly objectives to earn that lets you buy the items you would've gotten with the digital deluxe edition in a weekly rotating shop, so you can skip buying that overpriced edition and earn the goodies in-game instead. Though my major complaint is that both special currency shops have very sci-fi or fantasy feeling gear that for some reason MUST have glow in the dark textures, quite immersion breaking.

My only real gameplay complaint is regarding Yasuke and it's that he doesn't fit the vibe of an assassin, he's a big brute who excels at combat but that's it, he's not nimble, he literally crashes into walls and environmental objects when running, only things he can climb over efficiently is waist high fences. In Unity we could have assassin builds that relied around heavy weapons and armor but they still maintained some degree of agility and that cinematic smooth ""assassin feel"", Yasuke has none of that grace. So far I've spent 95% of my time as Naoe and I am glad the story focuses on her with Yasuke being in more of a supporting role.

Overall a good experience though I would wait for a sale since I do not support the idea of games now trying to normalise being 70€ for just the standard edition.",True,0,0,1742896385,76561198032281777,3425

Quick summary: 
- Engaging story and characters
- No open-world fatigue
- Fun, good-old ninja game
- Gameplay feels similar to other recent AC games, with tweaks to accommodate for a ninja / samurai play style

I've always wanted an Assassin's Creed set in feudal Japan, and this definitely meets and exceeds my hopes. Pay attention to the options in the start - some of them can change quite a bit of the experience, such as the spoken language (I've got the whole game in Japanese), automatic canon story choices (so it doesn't feel so gimmicky), and the difficulty. 

It feels a lot more manageable than for example AC: Odyssey, where you'd have more world markers than pixels on your screen. Other than that, it feels like a well done AC game in the style of AC: Origins and onwards (with the RPG elements, Mastery trees, experience system, etc.). 

Story-wise, my favorite thing is [spoiler]that it really feels like you're setting up a base of operations. You can piece together buildings, upgrade and customize them, and manage extra missions and scouts from your base. Nothing groundbreaking, but it adds to the story. It's a good-old revenge story, and the main character makes it engaging.[/spoiler]

I've mostly played as Naoe so far. I'm sure Yasuke comes along a bit more later on, but I think you can mostly choose between them. The cutscenes are decent, and have some real performance gems once in a while. Generally the facial expressions in-game are bland, but there have been moments in the cutscenes where they really shine. Nothing to write home about, but enough to keep me engaged in the characters. I like Naoe, I think she's a good character. 

Some of the cons: 
- Ubisoft Connect is still required. I keep forgetting my password and have to dig it out. Please ditch this, Ubisoft. 
- Lots and lots of cutscenes in the beginning. I'm not so cynical to insist that it's a deliberate attempt to bypass the 2-hour mark for refunding the game on Steam if you think it's not fun, but you don't actually get all that much gameplay during that time to evaluate. It feels like natural exposition, that's why I'm not complaining too much about it. If you can put down your controller in the start I think it can be enjoyable. 

Overall it's been pretty fun so far, and it doesn't feel like this game is going to give me open-world fatigue like many other games of this time does. Feels like it's more manageable, but I'm only 14 hours in so I can't fully tell yet.",True,0,1,1742896227,76561198072812496,1878

191136273,english,"It took a long enough time and went through a bunch of controversies, but we finally got Assassins Creed Shadows. To me, the game may not be the best the series ever has been, but it’s certainly one of the better of the open world Assassins Creed games. Whereas Valhalla had too much going on and Mirage not enough, Shadows strikes a good balance of having a decent sized map with plenty of activities to do but not so many that you become immediately overwhelmed. Many of the changes in Shadows were welcome from previous games. Shadows level up and equipment system is clean, easy to understand, and efficient with amazing gear transmogging. You can change individual parts of all the weapons and outfits to fit your taste without giving up the stats you are going to need. 

As far as characters go, I was at first worried about how Naoe and Yasuke were going to work, but after spending about 10 hours playing as each my worries were gone. Unlike Assassins Creed Syndicate where you play as essentially two identical characters, Shadows separates Naoe and Yasuke in the best ways possible. Naoe hits the perfect stealth element as a shinobi. She is agile, can climb anything, has a grappling hook, has access to tools such as smoke bombs, and has access to the Eagle Vision mechanic. However, Naoe has very low health and defenses, can’t move certain objects or use certain items, and isn’t very strong in combat. She is reliant on her stealth for her playstyle. On the other side is Yasuke who is an absolute unit. Yasuke does almost triple the damage Naoe does and has triple health. He has access to more weapons and can break down doors and move more items in the world. However, he’s slow and clumsy. While being able to climb, he does it slowly and can’t reach certain areas Naoe can. Yasuke also does not have the Eagle Vision mechanic. He is a straightforward fighter. Although they may be completely opposite in playstyle, I have not had issues doing my usual exploring, climbing, and synchronizing as either of them. This is a good thing as it makes both characters feel useful in most situations. The combat of the game is  fun, allowing you to use a multitude of insane abilities such as rushing the enemy with a giant katana slice or using a kusarigama to bring enemies down with its chain. 

The world is beautiful. I’ve found myself taking more pictures in this game than I have in the last few Assassin’s Creed games. I posted them all to look at as well. The world doesn’t feel empty, there is always a temple or a town to explore with treasure or questlines to start. I honestly haven’t done much of the main questline outside of a few of the required story missions but from what I have gathered from it so far, it’s your typical Assassins Creed plotline with a few twists and turns but nothing earthshaking or new (at least for now). In my opinion, I am giving this game a solid 8.5/10. It’s a fun entry in the series, and while it doesn’t do anything to make it the best in the series, it does set itself apart with its amazing world, setting, and interface.

191136149,english,"Ich möchte gar nicht zu sehr darüber ausschweifen wieso ich dieses AC Shadows so sehr liebe, sondern einfach nur eine positive Review hinterlassen, da das Spiel es eindeutig verdient hat. (wurde doch etwas länger, habe ein Fazit unten hinzugefügt)

Ein AAA Titel der im Jahr 2025 diese Bezeichnung WIRKLICH verdient hat, und das von Ubisoft in einem neuen Assassin's Creed... ich habe lange darauf gehofft, aber nicht wirklich damit gerechnet. Es FÜHLT sich einfach alles richtig an. Vom Combat über die Fortbewegung bis hin zum verbesserten Stealth. Als wäre den Spielern über die letzten Jahre trotz allem was man so denken mag WIRKLICH zugehört und sich vorgenommen worden diese Wünsche umzusetzen. Als hätten die Entwickler meine Gedanken gelesen, um herauszufinden, was ich mir wünsche und auch einfach BRAUCHE für ein solches Game. Es ist in manchen Momenten schon ein wenig surreal.

Shadows ist einfach nur ein wunderschönes Spiel, was einen den Alltag vergessen und im Feudalen Japan und der Story rund um Naoe und Yasuke versinken lässt. Das letzte Spiel, das mir so ein geniales Gefühl gegeben hat, war Elden Ring und bei FromSoftware erwartet man das ja schon fast inzwischen, auch wenn es bei weitem nicht selbstverständlich ist so konsistent zu sein. 
Die anderen großen, westlichen Studios schneiden sich hoffentlich eine große Scheibe von dem was Ubisoft Quebec hier geleistet hat ab! Genauso wie die Anzugträger bei Ubisoft hoffentlich endlich an den Zahlen sehen werden, was passieren kann, wenn man Spielern einfach gibt was sie haben wollen und dementsprechend auch den Entwicklern ZEIT lässt.

Um komplett transparent zu sein, muss ich aber auch dazu sagen, dass ich seit meinem letzten Assassin's Creed am PC ein ordentliches Hardware Upgrade hatte und deshalb auch die Optik in vollen Zügen genießen kann. Da das Spiel aber auf voller Länge gut ankommt und ich nichts von großen Launchproblemen lese kann und werde ich die Stabilität des Ganzen nicht komplett auf meinen Rechner schieben.

Fazit: Es handelt sich bei Assassin's Creed Shadows um einen AAA Titel von Ubisoft (muss man leider so sagen) der im Jahr 2025 ein unwerfend gutes Spiel mit, nach soweit ich weiß zweifachem Aufschub, stabilem Launch ist.

This game has the best stealth of the AC franchise by far, I really enjoy both of the protagonists however I do play Naoe much more than Yasuke just because I'm a stealth player so her playstyle suits mine better. The open world is beautiful and the lighting systems and seasons they have implemented really bring the world to life in a way I never thought it would.

191134935,english,"Honnêtement, cet épisode d'Assassin's Creed est facilement dans mon top 3 de mes Assassin's Creed préférés. Je n'ai pas encore terminer le jeu au moment où j'écris cette évaluation du jeu, mais il a le potentiel de détrôner mon Assassin's Creed préféré qui est Unity. 

Le raisonnement de mon top 3 est au final lequel parmis tous les épisodes de la série m'a fait le plus d'émotions et lesquels m'ont-ils le plus marqué. Avant de jouer à AC Shadows, l'ordre de ce top était Unity, Brotherhood et AC II. Ce sont les trois jeux Assassin's Creed dont j'ai le plus joué lorsque j'étais plus jeune et que je crackais mes jeux (désolé Ubisoft, mais j'ai fini par acheté les jeux sur mon compte Steam en commençant à travailler plus tard 🙏🏻). 

Assassin's Creed II a été mon premier jeux de la série dont j'ai joué par moi-même; le premier jeu avec Altaïr je regardais mon père jouer à l'époque. J'ai adoré l'histoire et le gameplay d'Assassin's Creed II en incarnant Ezio Auditore da Firenze. 

Puis, arriva plus tard Brotherhood dont j'ai ADORÉ l'évolution. Cet évolution vers Brotherhood dans le gameplay et toujours l'histoire encore plus épique m'a marqué à jamais. Je me rappel la première fois que j'ai pu mettre la main sur le jeu dans un EB Games (Gamestop) en démo. Que de bons souvenirs! La suite des jeux étaient cool aussi avec Revelations, AC III, Black Flag, etc. 

Mais, Unity avec Arno est le dernier jeu de la série qui m'a redonné cet effet ""WOW!"" comme Brotherhood m'avait donné. L'histoire qui était assez accrocheuse, Arno qui était un bon protagoniste, mais surtout.. LE GAMEPLAY! Le parkour plus exactement comme beaucoup ont aimé, mais aussi le système de combat plus réaliste je trouve. Un autre point qui n'a malheureusement pas suivi avec les suivants opus : La Co-op. J'aurait tant aimé que la Co-op persiste dans la série; Syndicate avait le potentiel d'avoir de la Co-op dans la campagne principale.. c'est dommage.

Encore une fois, Shadows avait également ce potentiel comme Syndicate d'avoir de la Co-op durant la trame principale du jeu, mais encore une fois dommage d'avoir passé à côté. Mais, malgré cela, ce jeu me donne à nouveau l'effet ""WOW!"" que je voulais d'un Assassin's Creed. Origin a presque réussi à me donner cet effet, mais la transition ""The Witcher-like"" m'a un tantinet perdu. Cet effet c'est amplifié avec Odyssey qui m'a malheureusement retiré l'engouement de finir l'histoire principale et de même pour Valhalla que je n'ai toujours pas joué, ni acheter. Cependant, j'ai acheté, joué et terminé Mirage dont j'ai apprécié le petit côté retour aux sources pas désagréable. Je crois que c'est grâce à lui que j'ai eu l'envie de me remettre dans le bain des Assassin's Creed. Sans lui, je ne sais pas si Shadows aurait terminé dans ma bibliothèque de jeux, ou bien j'aurais peut-être attendu à plus tard avant de me le procurer.

Bref, cet évaluation est plutôt vague, je n'ai pas vraiment parler explicitement ce qui m'attire dans AC Shadows. Pour faire bref, l'histoire est plutôt sympa quoique un peu cliché peut-être, le système de combat est potentiellement mon préféré de la série (à voir encore avec le temps si je ne change pas d'idée), Naoe est bien comme personnage tout comme Yasuke d'ailleurs, le système de discrétion avec Naoe est le meilleur de la série à mes yeux et l'environnement du Japon avec le système de météo est un régale.

Donc, je recommande cet épisode au moment où j'écris ces lignes pour les fans de la série ou même pour ceux qui sont curieux de découvrir le monde d'Assassin's Creed avec un épisode mélangeant plutôt intelligemment l'ancienne recette d'Assassin's Creed avec la nouvelle recette introduite depuis Origins.",True,0,0,1742891346,76561198063804005,2375

191132135,english,"Shadows has the best stealth gameplay of the series and this is what carries it.  You even play as a character that makes sense to be an assassin (a ninja) vs prior titles.  The series gets a much needed modern game engine upgrade too.  The visual tech is great. 

Infiltrating bases and taking out enemies is fun. The grappling hook is a great aide in vertical exploration.  Being able to go prone opens up a lot more areas to stealth and assassinations.  Finally being able to use light (or the lack of it) to hide in is great.  Your toolset makes ranged assassinations and daring escapes via ninja smoke bombs possible.  Parkour works well enough to get you in and out of sticky situations.  Exploring the beautiful world is pretty fun too, although it is dampened by how many unclimbable obstacles you’ll encounter.  You’re pretty much relegated to the main roads.  Why can’t we climb trees?

The main issue I have with this game is the combat.  You have an arsenal of multiple weapon types, tools, abilities, parrying, dodging, weak points, etc.  The game regularly throws groups of enemies at you to fight.  The difficulty descriptions even state that group combat is not the way to go on Normal difficulty, so why is this the main scenario the game throws at you? It really doesn’t work well.   Enemies spam unblockable attacks or long combos from all sides.  The lock on and parry system become a hindrance to try to use in these scenarios.  It’s more effective to constantly dodge.  It feels clunky and imprecise.  Once you have enough abilities and upgrades unlocked it’s not as bad, but it never feels good.

The base building and scout system seem like half baked ideas. You’re quickly able to build all the main buildings and upgrade them.  Scouts are used for three arbitrary tasks (find objectives, pick up large resources, or clear your wanted levels).  These tasks used to be doable directly by you in previous games.  Why introduce a middleman gameplay mechanic to do these?  The first one can at least be disabled in the options.  This is what Ubisoft meant by saying that the map wouldn’t tell you exactly where to go.  It meant you had to click on the objective area on the map and have a scout discover the objective marker instantly.

The story seems non-existent.  It’s completely non linear, which means there’s no development of anything once you’re past the intro.  You’re given a hit list and told to go for it.

Cutscenes are bizarrely capped at 31 fps with terrible stuttering despite all being real time.

It’s not a bad game, but it’s not as great as so many are making it out to be.  It’s a decent game to play casually with the gameplay loop being, what’s the next base to infiltrate and who’s the next assassination target.  Everything else can be ignored.

If you are on the fence, i havent enjoyed an assassins creed this much since Black Flag. 
Shadows is certainly better then Valhalla, Origins and Odyssey. Those being the titles ive played.

My biggest gripe is sometimes the combat music seems to modern. just feels out of place.
Havent experienced any notable bugs or anomalies.

The narrative and environmental story telling is a step up from their recent titles, i find my self interested enough to stop and help people in trouble to find out what they have to say.

191131416,english,"As someone who has played every Assassin’s Creed game to date, Shadows is shaping up to be my absolute favorite. The combat is much tougher and more strategic—no more waltzing through enemy camps without a plan. Some of the bases are huge, and if you're going full stealth, expect to spend 45+ minutes sneaking through, planning your moves, and picking off enemies with precision. It’s tense in the best way.

The controls are tight, the exploration feels rewarding, and unlike some previous entries, it never gets boring. I’ve seen a lot of negative reviews, but honestly, I don’t get it. Maybe it's not for the casual hack-and-slash crowd, but for long-time fans like me, it feels like a true return to form with a fresh edge.

I was a massive fan of Odyssey, and while I’ve sunk a ton of time into Shadows already, I’m still early in the story and haven’t seen much of the traditional Assassin’s Creed lore yet—but that hasn’t hurt my enjoyment at all. The new base-building system is another highlight: it’s no longer just about upgrading structures, but actually designing your hideout. What to build, where to place it, and how it all comes together—it’s got way more depth and customization than ever before.

So far, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a standout experience. If you're a longtime fan, this one's worth diving into.",True,0,0,1742885607,76561198057293134,1370

Finally, after long time and possibly most wanted historical setting by fans, we got Shadows.

If you played any of modern RPG AC games, you will find a lot of similarities in Shadows too with some tweaks (upgrades) in combat. I will be honest with my first impression/""review"".

First thing when you open a game, you are greeted with big shop screen of Ubisoft. Where you can buy: gear, weapons, mount, exp boost, skill boost and map reveal. Same as in other RPG AC games, they also push mtx in our face as much as possible. Preorder locked content/day one season pass dlc etc.
Ads/in game mtx is something I will never support in single player game.


I played few hours until you can freely explore/switch between two protagonist (dont know why its stuck to 2.2 -maybe because I was offline on steam by default), and already you can notice what to expect. (If you played Origins, Odyssey or Valhalla you will too). 

World is massive and beautiful, and to my surprise, game runs great - no fps drops, no glitches/bugs etc so far. Map is again massive in size but feels empty. Enemy variety is lacking, hideouts feels the same after awhile (copy paste) but secrets are fun to find and makes exploration rewarding.

AC Shadows story did not hooked me at all - maybe it becomes better later. So far it is mostly cliché with very dumbed down dialogue. Voice acting is the worst in whole franchise, I would recommend to swap to Japanese for better experience. 

Combat/stealth/gameplay is as before, nothing new. There are few tweaks with better focus on stealth and differences between two characters.  My guess is that you will, later on, unlock some skill that you will abuse/spam as in previous games. Does not mean its not fun but I wish they done something new. It does not help AI is braindead as it was in Star Wars Outlaws.

Two main characters are, in my opinion, boring. Its clear Naoe fits/feels much better - in combat, stealth, animations, movment etc.


Yasuke does not fit in this game at all. Not because of his race, but because of his brute playstyle and hard focus on it. He lack in everything, even animations in comparison to Naoe, and that is shame. But its fun to play as absolute unit.

AC takes inspiration from historical events and here in Shadows, you can choose to follow canon (historically ""accurate"" as they claim) and improvised that gives you more freedom - a welcome option. I choose canon events and still many things did jot have any logic at all- and i dont know why many are afraid to mention this flaw. -How can Yasuke become a samurai just after 6 months, from slave? -Why do villagers bow down to him? -Why does he have Japanese accent when he arrived from Portugal as slave? Etc etc etc... That is fiction, not canon Ubisoft. 

Overall, AC Shadows is what you would expect from modern AC game. Fun open word RPG with many flaws that becomes boring after awhile. Hype is strong atm, but this is not worth 70 euro. There is nothing new, and game is meh. 6 out of 10 but I will not recommend at current price. Mtx/in game store is also one of reasons.",False,0,1,1742885115,76561198092583697,986

They are so deathly afraid of assassin’s creed, they would rather have their souls sucked out by a dementor than actually make an assassin’s creed game.

Leading up to its release, Like many AC's before it had it's fair share of Criticism especially when it comes to historical accuracy and their infamous bugs in their later titles. Ubisoft does a great job with bringing the past to life albeit with a few twists here and there. The extra few months of polish definitely seems to have helped avoid the bugs they usually have at launch and I've only encountered a few in the early hours. But only if I'm looking for them. One suggestion I may make is to add a option to sell/breakdown items you no longer want all at once instead of waiting 4 seconds per item every time is just plain silly. I hope this is the start of a new era for Ubisoft and to truly take this game as a following example for future titles. While I'm only a mere 15 hours in with a 100 more to go ( To be expected ) Its left its mark enough for me to leave a review.

The game starts slower than most, with some very heavy story content that you can't avoid.  If you hate story and don't want to learn about the characters and their backstory this may annoy you. The particles of leaves and trees that sway in the wind build a great amount of immersion for you to enjoy detailed sassing. Rain and other weather effects seem to change some aspects to combat too, like hearing and visibility of enemies.

The art and quality of the world environment in this game is pretty damn spiffo. The season system is confusing at first and I often find myself trying to avoid it progressing. 

The combat feels messy and rudementary at first but, at least while playing on hardest difficulty, there is a lot of timing and nuance to mastering it.  Occasionally I will die to an enemy because I can't take a dodge or parry action while I'm locked into a finisher. It feels unfair but isn't enough to make me give up playing.

191121574,english,"Assassin's Creed follows a formula.  And if you like that formula, this is certainly a great AC game.  I've seen a lot of comparisons to Ghost of Tsushima, but it is not a fair comparison, they are different games.  I am personally a fan of the AC formula, and I think that this is a great addition to the AC canon.  

For those that played Valhalla, Odyssey and Origins, this is similar in scope, but a bit more refined.  They stripped back a lot of the clutter you find in those games (Valhalla, especially), and all of the ""collectibles"" seem to fit the story much more effectively.  The missions are much better organized, the equipment system still has plenty of options, but without some of the bloat.  Like Valhalla, you will have some headquarters building to do, but there is a lot more to customize and it fits the story a lot better.  

Speaking of the story, there is far  more of a story line in this iteration of AC, something we haven't seen for several iterations.  Some may not love the long cut-scenes, or the amount of deposition.  But I actually welcome it.  The story has far more gravity than some of the more recent entries.  And so far (because I haven't yet finished the game), the story seems to be right up there with Origins or Black Flag in terms of quality.  

If I had any complaints, it would be in the voice acting and the character animation.  I feel like we took a step back here.  Some of the voice acting is very robotic, filled with inappropriate pauses, etc.  As for character animation, the dialog sequences are where it fails.  Facial expressions are blank and robotic.  A character's actions seem mechanical (think of the animatronics at a Disney dark ride).  The quality in this regard has slipped several iterations - all the way back to Black Flag, if not earlier.  Fortunately, animation as you move about the world is smooth.  Combat is solid and looks great.  The poor animation is really limited to the dialog.  I guess dialog in general is the real shortcoming here.  Thankfully, the content of the dialog is actually pretty good, just poorly acted. 

UPDATE:  A friend suggested that I play with the Japanese language for dialog, but use English subtitles (since I don't speak Japanese).  This significantly helps the voice acting.  It's very possible that since I don't know the language, I'm simply not distracted by bad acting.  But I actually think the voice acting in the Japanese language is just better. <END Update>

Speaking of combat, I think this is possibly the best combat system in all of AC.  I don't think the player's actions are all that much more dramatically improved.  Though they do add stances as a new feature (how could they not considering the setting?).  Where I think there is improvement is the AI.  The enemies seem much more responsive, almost like they learn some patterns.  I can't confirm, but it does seem like the AI is significantly improved.  

If you're an AC fan, you may miss some of the parkour.  There's still plenty to climb, but not as much to jump between as you might find in other games.  I don't think it's a big loss, however.  You get a grappling hook that you can use to climb large overhanging roofs, arches, or other objects overhead.  But then there's the stealth.  If I'm being honest, stealth seemed to get put aside on Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla.  It returned for Mirage, but it wasn't really an upgrade...just that the enemies were more powerful so you were faced with consequences.  Much of Shadows really does punish you if you are not using stealth, and I love that aspect.  But stealth in this game also adds a crawling function which allows you to sneak by in tall grass, but some attacks aren't available from that position.  I welcome this new dynamic.

So in short summary, Shadows is a great AC game.  Fans of the franchise will certainly find something to love here.  But just be ready to cringe a little with the voice acting and the dialog animations.  If you're looking for Ghost of Tsushima, this is not it.  That's an apples-to-oranges comparison, so stop that.  As far as AC games go, I think this is pretty high on the rankings for me.  Odyssey and Syndicate still remain among my favorites, but this just seems to merge the best features of both of those without all the bloat.  So I would recommend this game for fans of the franchise.  If you're new to the franchise, this is certainly great as a stand-alone game with no prior knowledge of the canon.",True,0,0,1742871127,76561198023691169,1510

191121146,english,"As someone who loved Odyssey I'm loving Shadows just as much. If you've enjoyed modern Assassin's Creed games, Shadows is definitely worth checking out. And if you wish those games had more of the old school AC feel, Naoe's gameplay brings that feeling back in a good way.

In terms of gameplay, Shadows seems more difficult than previous games. You can't spiderman climb up any wall, you will actually need to think about your approach sometimes. Stealth, at least on the highest difficulty, is much more challenging. Enemies will notice you walking around on roofs and peaking out from cover very quickly. And once an enemy spots Naoe, She will die in 3-4 hits. I find myself using every tool given to me to stay in stealth and alive, though as I unlock more skills it is slowly getting easier. 

Fantastic Visuals. Weather and seasons change the whole feel of the world. Ultra settings, 3440x1440, with no framegen and upscaling set to quality on a 9070xt gets me around 64 fps average. While that isn't amazing, it is an extremely stable framerate, with 1% lows in the very high 50s. Haven't seen any hitching, and no bugs other than getting stuck in objects a couple of times.

Really enjoying Naoe and Yasuke, they are by far the most likable player characters of the series. I'm actually looking forward to finding more of the flashbacks so I can learn more of their backstories.

Overall if you hate new AC, the existence of micro-transactions (they are easy to ignore), or Ubisoft in general, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is probably not for you.

191121024,english,"I didn't go into this game with particularly high hopes. That said, I was pleasantly surprised. Naoe is great to play, and is basically your standard AC game protagonist. She's possibly a bit squishier than in other games, but otherwise what you'd expect. Yasuke is quite different. He can't really climb much, he's slow, he's noisy.. and he's basically an unstoppable tank. He's the dude you just go knock the door down with and start wrecking everyone's face with.

Both of their stories are interesting enough, and Yasuke surprisingly fits in well as he is presented. I wasn't expecting it, but he works here. The gameplay is what you'd expect if you've played any recent AC games.

My only real complaint so far is the music.. occasionally. In several cutscenes the game wants to portray as ""epic"" or whatever, this weird modern techno music starts playing that I can honestly only describe as ""Afro Samurai"". It's horribly out of place and doesn't work at all. It's even stranger when it plays early in the game in Naoe's scenes before she ever meets Yasuke. That said, it's infrequent enough that I can overlook it and enjoy the game.

Edit: After finishing basically everything in the game (70 hours in).. I suppose I do have one final complaint. The ending of the story was one of the most anticlimactic I've ever seen. Nothing felt resolved or finished, there didn't really feel like there was any big final boss, and Naoe didn't even really have any part in the final few missions, which were instead solely focused on Yasuke and his past. I'd still recommend this, and even argue that it's one of the better AC games of the past decade.. but I was expecting, well, an ending?",True,0,0,1742870416,76561198042238818,4200

Unfortunately for this game Ghost of Tsushima came out almost 5 years ago and just generally does everything this game tries to do but better.

191120002,english,"How many years as it been now and they still don't know how to do open world gaming properly.

Elden Ring. See location in the distance that looks interesting, go there, do the thing, get reward immediately when you finish.

Every Ubisoft open world game. NPC gives you quest, you look at map, find the location, fast travel to nearest location, call your horse, go there, do the thing, open up map to find NPC, fast travel to nearest location, call your horse, go there, get reward. Just let me explore uninterrupted with the least amount of map use and fast travel as possible. I know map inspection and fast travelling are unavoidable in open world games but Ubisoft are the absolute worse because they use it as a crutch to pad out the play time. I'd say a good 50-60% of my time is spent just trying to get to places to do things.

But is the journey to these places at least fun?

The mountainous forests of Japan are not particularly intuitive friendly to travel. You mark a tower to climb on your map so you can scout the area for points of interest. Ok, but there is a huge forest in front of it and no path that seems to lead to it. Well Ubisoft have implemented a feature that will guide you to the location with a trailing white line on the ground, you may as well turn your brain off at that point, or your can skyrim horse it, take a straight line and hope there isn't a slope greater than 45 degrees and be swamped with trees for the next 5 minutes.

There is a necessity to travel around village areas of no consequence in the hopes of unlocking a fast travel locations (kakurega) just so you wouldn't be wasting your time further down the line if a quest location happens to pop up nearby.

Knowledge point busy work. Knowledge lets you use higher tiers of your skill tree. You don't need to do activities to increase knowledge to advance the story but it is necessary if you want to expand your repertoire in and out of combat. The problem? Every activity to gain knowledge is easy and plain boring and requires the boring exploration to reach these locations. You need a lot of knowledge points to hit the max skill tier. At 35 hours I hit tier 6 while doing very little of the story.

The one thing this game has going for it are the graphics. They managed to squeeze out a whole lot of visual fidelity, more than any other game to date.",False,0,1,1742869155,76561198001958458,2558

191119633,english,"As a longtime fan who's played every Assassin's Creed game, I really wanted this to succeed. But Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a visually stunning shell hiding a frustrating, shallow experience. Here's a breakdown:

✅ The Good:

Beautiful Graphics: Incredible lighting, ray tracing, and world design. Visually, it’s immersive.

Runs Well (After Tweaks): Once optimized, the game runs smoothly.

Exploration Feels Natural: The world invites exploration—even if there’s not much payoff.

❌ The Bad:

Story & Characters:

Weak and repetitive story that rarely picks up.

Main characters feel inconsistent—Naoe especially shifts personalities constantly.(main quest feel like side quest)

Yusuke feels like a background character despite being a co-lead.

Relationships and emotional moments feel rushed or unnatural.

Gameplay & Progression:

Repetitive missions (same objectives, same structure).

Shallow assassination list—feels like a checklist, not a meaningful experience.

Gear progression is meaningless: legendary loot gets outclassed fast.

Knowledge system is grindy and replaces real skill trees.

Artificial time-wasting mechanics to inflate playtime.

Design Choices:

Feels more like a live-service/gacha game than a proper AC title.

Game loop seems built to push microtransactions—gear and progression shortcuts are sold behind paywalls.

You must grind endlessly just to unlock basic abilities.

Tone & Identity:

Assassin’s Creed has lost its identity—tries to be everything (RPG, stealth, samurai sim) but ends up doing none well.

Game feels like a Trojan horse: pretty outside, empty inside.

Industry Critique:

Media outlets giving it inflated scores while real player feedback is far more critical.

Feels like Ubisoft refuses to listen to fans, doubling down on bad decisions.

Some devs blaming players for not liking the game, which only adds fuel to the fire.

If you're only here for the visuals, you might enjoy it. But if you're here for story, gameplay, or meaningful Assassin’s Creed mechanics, prepare to be disappointed. I don’t recommend it—and if you do play it, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

191116144,english,"I've thoroughly played every single Assassin's Creed game, and this one will be no different. Here are two pros and cons for this latest addition.

I know, you know, we all know — this game is super casual and totally for everyone. It's for people who can't spend hours exploring or coming up with ridiculous ways to break the game. And you know what? That's totally okay! Hardcore players might find it a bit boring, but hey, you’re not the target audience here, so just let it go. Seriously, it’s fine.

They’re designed to be satisfying. And honestly, I’m personally thrilled about certain things because it feels like someone actually listened to us. In previous games, we all complained about losing the whole 'assassin' vibe, going from gladiators to vikings, and literally obliterating Cyclops and Christians like gods of war. Still satisfying, but not exactly what we were looking for in an Assassin's Creed game. Well… prayers answered! Now we can go full ninja mode with Naoe.

The fact that (so far) we don’t have an eagle to spot every single enemy and loot is chef’s kiss great. I actually have to look around now, be more observant, more careful... It gives just the right tension I’ve been craving. Sure, there’s still the ‘eagle vision’ (because apparently, it’d be so hard without it :^] ), but I just avoid using it.

And there are so many other little details that get us into shinobi mode! The new variety of bushes, hiding in shadows, the crucial role of noise, traps, and the fact that enemies are way more perceptive. They spot you from miles away, are super alert to every little sound , I love it. Also, if you climb rooftops in winter, it makes way too much noise because of the ice falling. It's the little things, right?

The second main point — and no one can argue with this — the game is gorgeous. I mean, absolutely gorgeous. I think I spent half my time in photo mode just admiring flowers, butterflies, and sunsets. I love how the seasons and weather change; each one has an impact on gameplay, especially on stealth. And don’t even get me started on the lighting! When the weather gets stormy, there's this beautiful, ominous greenish gloom... Also, I really like how they slowed down the night and day cycle. It fits, since stealth is much more efficient during the night thanks to all the hiding in the shadows. And mostly, I love that it actually makes me react to the time of day as well as the weather. It makes me interact more with the world, and that's one of the main things you want in a video game. During the day, I do side tasks, explore, etc. But as soon as the sun starts setting, I prepare for a castle!

However… now, let’s get to my cons.

As I mentioned earlier, the game is meant to be casual. But come on, it really could use more challenge. In fights and pretty much everything else. Sure, they put in some effort with the exploring mode, even though I think the scouting mechanic was a bit unnecessary, but hey, we don’t have to use it. The game really doesn’t reward curiosity, though — everything is handed to you on a silver platter. Legendary items? Easy to find and you can grab them super early. By the first zone, you’ve already got a full set of gear, so the other non-legendary items just become junk to sell. In fact, all the resources are way too easy to find. I’ve already almost finished building and upgrading everything in the camp, and I’ve barely left the first zone. It’s like I'm living the dream — I never run out of pocket money or materials to upgrade my gear. I wish I could say in real life but at this point, I feel filthy rich, and i barely left the first zone. I wish there was more of a resource management aspect, where I actually had to make decisions on what to prioritize.

As for the fights, the choreography is very satisfying to watch, and the mechanics fun, but... where’s the challenge? I always play on maximum difficulty to truly enjoy a game, but Assassin's Creed always frustrates me in this department. The only challenge comes from the ones I create for myself, like refusing to use certain stealth features. But knowing that if I get caught, I’m not really in much trouble anyway kinda kills the tension. (guys the kunais are waaaaay too overpowered) Oh, and if you die, don’t worry — the game auto-saves you like, two minutes before anyway. So… meh.

Also, I'm kind of baffled by the enemies' awareness in stealth mode. They’re sharp, but the second I start fighting, they become blind and deaf. I can literally kill one enemy in the same house if a another, and the guy standing 15 meters away is just midly alerted or sometimes he doesn’t even hear the fight. That’s just weird.

But my second and main con — and I think we can all agree on this one — the writing? Hello? I mean, okay, maybe it’s a bit harsh to judge the story when we haven’t finished the game yet. I see you, you haven’t finished it either, and neither have I (and I will problably come back on this review when i finished it). But let’s be real, we’re off to a very ominous start. Come on, give me something. Give me emotion, give me gruesome, that'll make me feel something! I mean, I cried my eyes out when I had to carry the dying body of Mary in Black Flag. That was raw. I laughed my ass off with Kassandra in Odyssey, whom I grew very fond of with her witty humor. Here? Even if the main characters died, I don’t think I’d care much. They’re like cardboard cutouts with no soul, and their stories? Empty. I've seen better vengeance and redemption arcs in Totally Spies.

Last little point about Yasuke… Honestly, I think he’s neither good nor bad — it’s just a different gameplay style. But I’m not really a fan of having to switch between the two. It feels a bit forced. I get that they’re trying to offer variety, but it kind of breaks the flow. I just want to stick with one and get really good at it, not constantly have to juggle between different styles. Feels like I’m trying to play two games at once and neither of them is getting the love they deserve.

Now, why do I recommend this game nevertheless? Puppies.",True,0,1,1742864523,76561198229820068,4224
191116124,english,"A review for this game requires so much unnecessary context because of how idiotic the gaming community has become, especially a positive one. But I feel obligated to share my thoughts for this reason. I am going to split this review into bite-sized points as opposed to paragraphs for those with low attention spans. 

Ignore my playtime, I am using cross save on PS5, but this is a phenomenal PC port (check out Digital Foundry on Youtube honestly, and watch their vid on it). If you feel like skipping the BS, I will label sections. Also, TLDR: I think this is probably the overall best game in the series and one of the most impressive open world games in recent memory, fight me. 

My GAMER CRED:

I have played every Assassin's Creed (AC) game in the series multiple times. I replay my favorite entries semi-annually, from Black Flag to Syndicate. I pre-ordered the original game's collector's edition back for the launch on the Xbox 360 when I was in high school or something like that. I did the same for AC2, 3, and so on. 

I have played every AC game no matter how crappy at launch and probably 100 percent-ed them. I have even played random entries like Rogue multiple times (I really like games based in historical settings, okay). So there is my background with the series, it is one of my favorites, I love history, I studied it at university, I love games that tackle settings with some attempt at authenticity. 

I have reviewed games for a living before, I have written for games media, so I am intimately familiar with the workings of game reviews from an outlet side. Increasingly the AC games are terrible for review environments due to their massive scale and somewhat laborious pacing. As someone who has had to review a lot of games under a time crunch, it ruins almost any game, but especially ones like AC Shadows that demand to be soaked up and explored at your own pace. 

I have literally 500 hrs in Ghost of Tsushima and the Plat, as well as another 100 in Rise of the Ronin and the platinum. Both I pre-ordered and played day one on console. To say I love Samurai themed stuff is an understatement.

The ""Controversy"":

There has been so much stupid controversy around this game that it would never have garnered had it come out like five years ago. Yasuke is a common protagonist in alternative history media, and if you play the game, he clearly plays second fiddle to Naoe who is an S-tier protagonist for the series from an Assassin/stealth focus. 

To call the game historically inaccurate when compared to other AC games, let alone other samurai games is an utter farce and bad faith in every conceivable way. In Assassin's Creed 2 you literally fist fight the pope, Leonardo Da Vinci builds you a flying batwing glider, and Venice looks clean. Assassin's Creed 3 basically tries to whitewash American history by placing a Native American man in every major moment and battle. You literally watch them sign The Declaration of Independence, it is so stupid it borderlines on comedy. AC as a series is full of ahistorical nonsense. If Yasuke is the most egregious slight against history Shadows commits, then it is easily the most historically accurate AC game by a mile. 

The Setting/Historical Focus:

The game is the first entry that has an immersive language mode that combines Portuguese and Japanese. The acting is phenomenal in this mode, and it it is properly lip-synced (something Ghost of Tsushima didn't have at launch not to compare it negatively, more on that later) the game revels in history and culture in a way I have never seen AC take so seriously (I am not implying that the game is perfectly accurate though). Even major story beats center around learning about Japanese culture, such as an early quest involving tea ceremonies. The game has plodding pacing at times because it loves to revel in the authenticity of it's setting.

In comparison to games like Rise of the Ronin or Ghost of Tsushima from a historical perspective, even a 7 foot black samurai can't beat how absurd those games treat history at times. From similarly goofy gliders to the wholesale fiction that is Tsushima's story (not that it is a bad story necessarily).

Also, the game treats Yasuke realistically in the world, NPCs gawk at him, he is massive and terrifying to a culture that has never seen someone like him. The game represents his experience well as well as the way people would react to him. The literal opening of the game is about his appearance and how he comes into Oda Nobunaga's service. The game directly mirrors historical accounts in the opening. 

Stealth Gameplay:

The series has literally never had stealth this good. Acting like Unity had good stealth is as brain dead as acting like AC has always been some historically accurate paragon and that Yasuke is somehow where we draw the line. Unity barely ran at 30 fps at launch, it was famously glitchy, full of microtransactions, online BS and weird community content, terrible, arbitrary leveling, co-op that barely worked.

Shadows has the most robust stealth in the entire franchise easily, with prone, a large set of tools, dynamic lighting, the ability to snuff light sources by hand or with thrown weapons, shallow swimming, prone assassinations, etc. etc. It has splinter cell levels of stealth depth. Enemies can even see players projected shaodow and react to it. So the stealth is peak. 

The Combat:
Another wake up moment, AC has basically never had good combat. Even the best ones have little or no challenge. It is basically just watching cool kill animations, the video game. It is fun as a power fantasy but not as a satisfying set of mechanics. Combat was always all style, no substance. Luckily this game basically drops all the goofy crap and hack and slashi-ness of the past three thankfully. 

Honestly, Shadows is probably the best combat in the series. It is lethal and deliberate, with a fun armor system where you dynamically strip armor off of enemies. It is satisfying to have an in-game detail that correlates to the meter above their head, as opposed to something like a posture meter. But, you can also break enemy posture with perfect dodges or parrying series of attacks ala Sekiro. 

Attacking enemies who aren't having their posture broken will result in them blocking you almost every time, especially samurai and trained soldiers. Another fun detail is that Ashigaru and other low ranking soldiers are usually poorly trained and armorless. They are easy to instantly kill, and won't parry your moves unlike other trained units. They even will just hold up their weapons horizontally to try and brute force block your attacks as opposed to the Samurai and other units that will parry. The game is full of little details like this that add to gameplay. 

Combat is great, it is plenty deep, especially for ac, the animations are awesome finally, the visuals are fantastic, the blood effects are amazing, and you can behead fools. C'mon people, we have been wanting this forever, and this game delivers on that in spades. Plus you can use a Kusarigama, one of the best weapons ever, and it rules. It has it's own skill-tree. 

The World:
It is mind-blowing, seriously, Ubisoft's upgrades to the ANVIL engine show with built-in RTGI. The game is astounding at every turn with easily the most natural looking and lush open-world since Red Dead. Especially with the addition of seasons. The NPCs are always doing interesting things, they react to weather changes, your actions, and they will take out lanterns at night or fun little things like that. Most are doing real world activities based on their location as well, with a lot of historically accurate and cute little details, like monks making rice and handing it out to peasants outside of a temple.

There are positives and negatives, of course. Let's start with the negatives:

1. Some of the dialogue (in English) does at times sound really bad, like they are trying too hard to make the characters ""unique sounding"" or whatever. Or maybe they're just bad at speaking English. It's kind of off-putting for me, and even though I don't consider it a major problem during gameplay, it certainly reduces the overall quality the game.
2. The opening segment of the game is way too long and it takes a long time before you actually get to play the game in it's entirety. This is just bad game design in my opinion. I can handle a 30 minute intro to set the stage, but when you spend hours upon hours playing through cutscenes and memories to ""build the story"" - it becomes a drag. 
3. Even though this is an open world game, it does lack in that department. The NPC's are not really interactive and they do their own thing so the world doesn't feel as alive and lived in as it could have. Also, I feel like I am ""stuck"" in the first area of the map because I am not at a high enough level to explore the rest of the map in a safe way (meaning I would die if a guard as much as sneezed towards me).
4. I find it immersion-breaking that I am more or less forced to switch between two completely different characters. I just spent 20-30 hours connecting with the main character Naoe, which I think is a great character and also acts more or less like an Assassin (or a Ninja). Then the game ""pivots"" and introduces this new character into the game, permanently, who is barely able to drag himself over a wall. I do not like that. Give me one character, please. If Ubisoft want players to have different playing experiences like this, they should instead let people create their own unique character builds fitting their playstyle. Not force their hand.

The positives:

1. Obviously, the graphics are stunning.
2. The crafted (and generated) world is absolutely gorgeous and it will undoubtedly take your breath away. Other games have this ability too, it's nothing new, but I don't think I have ever seen it done so beautiful as in Assassins Creed Shadows. You will never run out of amazing vistas, that's for sure.
3. To accompany the stunning world and the beautiful graphics, are both impressive weather systems and seasonal changes that make the game feel very, very immersive at times. It also gives great variety to the environment, which is good because it will keep you in contact with the elements so to speak, or the world around you. 
For example; the fact that bodies of water freezes during winter time, and that your character can kind of ""tremble"" and skate with their feet on that ice is such a cool feature that helps you realize that you are in a completely different environment than say compared to spring or summer. Another example would be that you could encounter snowy terrain during a mountain traversal, and the higher up you get the more snowy and colder it gets. 
These systems, and the immersion they bring, are especially effective when you are out exploring the forests or the mountains as it kind of makes the journey more interesting - but it can also be equally, or even more so, fantastical and dramatic to fight an epic sword battle inside of a castles garden when the clouds are pitch black and rain is just pouring down.
4. Musical score is very good, intriguing and varied. I find myself get lost in the game quite a lot because of the musical score.
5. The stealth gameplay is terrific and probably the best provided in any Assassins Creed game so far.

Rating: 7/10
Notice I did not put the game story as either a positive or a negative aspect of the game. That's because I think it's completely mediocre. It's just good enough to take you through the game and enjoy it, but sadly not very engaging. Had the story and the dialogue been at a high level, I would have given it a 8/10 or maybe even a 9/10.

And for the kids out there: I hope you have the sense to ignore the Youtubers and the journalists who are making exaggerated, sensational content about Ubisoft or this game, only to provide themselves with more clicks/views. Their method is to outright ""hate"" a game they either barely played or didn't play at all. Either that, or they simply repeat negative reviews from other Youtubers who gave negative reviews. It's absolutely pathetic how they allow themselves to be without any sort of integrity, meaning they will literally say or post anything whether it holds any truth or not. A news article popped up somewhere saying something, they recite it. Remember that, a video on Youtube is just one person. An article on the internet is just one person. It's easy to be fooled into thinking their content might hold more weight or be more true than it really is. Try to imagine that they are saying these things to your face instead of through your phone. It's their opinion/or a false claim printed on a screen. I recently noticed one video where the title was something along the lines of AC Shadows had become a flop. Which is absolutely not true at all. My response was to ignore the video (not look at it) and to tell Youtube algorithm to never recomend me that channel again. This is the way.
But that's actually how toxic a lot of these media people are. At least where I live, media have a certain level of standard for truth. Thankfully. The problem with Youtubers though is that they can say whatever they want, there's no governance at all for their content. They make more money the more sensational the topic is. That's just their line of business. And for them, there is nothing ""big"" about AC Shadows being a good game and Ubisoft actually doing a decent job. These people actually want Ubisoft to fail, they want AC Shadows to flop, because that creates a story they can cover endlessly (""Let's talk about Ubisofts downfall blablablavblal""). So they are already, and in spite of the game being a tremendous success so far, spending a lot of energy to support the outcome that somehow Ubisoft will be in big trouble for the way they handled Shadows.
Now, I'm not naive, there are certainly a lot of problems within the modern gaming industry. Ubisoft are also responsible for their part in this. But the players should be able to discuss these problems from a factual and a serious point of view, and at the same time be able to recognize a good game when they see one. 
I guess I'm just saying: please don't believe in everything you read or see on the internet. Another tip is to just get the game, play it and make up your own mind before you read or look at reviews from a game. I do it this way myself, and it leaves me free of any prejudice.",True,0,21,1742859555,76561197982049726,2408

191111784,english,"I'm just over 15 hours into the game and loving it. I know its early in my play through to say this, but it might be my favorite AC game now. I'm also just a huge fan of Japanese themed games.

Overall: I honestly don't know why there is so much controversy surrounding this game.  The world design/graphics are stunning with dense forests and detailed towns & castles. The game seems polished with little to no bugs, I think I've only encountered one so far.  So far the story has been great, really intense cut scenes that make you want to watch and not skip. Stealth seems to have an upgrade from previous games, enemies seem smarter then previous titles and you can adjust that setting in the game. Great skill tree that's organized well and makes you want to progress and do side quests. Combat is fun, intense, and brutal. 

Characters: At first I was hesitant about having 2 protagonists to play as, however, after playing both I'm happy the developers did that.  The female character will scratch that itch to play as a ninja, you can hide in shadows, quick agile fighting, flips off stuff when climbing.  But then you can switch at any time to the male character and play as a Samurai. Bigger, Stronger, and Slower but man he's a tank and you feel unstoppable playing as him.  I think the two options keep the game interesting and give the player two very different ways to play the game. I also love the new light system the made, putting out lanterns and hiding in the shadows is sick.  

In game store: One last thing, in regards to the in game store to buy skins and stuff.  I can understand people don't like micro transactions, but no one is forcing you to buy something. There are never pop ups or ads to remind you to visit the store. Its there if you want it but you don't have to look at it if you don't want to lol.  I personally don't think its a big deal, some of the skins are kinda cool anyway. 
 
I give the game 10/10 in my personal opinion and recommend people get the game if they are on the fence.",True,0,0,1742859371,76561198373661229,2014

Assuming you do not care about that, this is a mid-level ""average"" game. The graphics are good, and the Japanese theme is cool. But that is where the good stops. They try to make the game an arduous grind, offering ways to skip that grind by spending money on upgrades such as skill points and map icons.

The world is stunning, the combat is fluid, and switching between Naoe (shinobi) and Yasuke (samurai) keeps things fresh. The stealth is solid, and Yasuke’s brute-force playstyle is a nice contrast. The weather system and lighting effects make the world feel alive, especially during storms or at night.

191106338,english,"With the new lighting-based stealth system, Shadows easily stands out as the best in the series for stealth gameplay. It genuinely enhances the experience, and I hope it stays in the series moving forward. Combat, on the other hand, can be tough, especially when you're outnumbered or facing an unfamiliar enemy type with a new move set. It’s not terrible, but it’s not groundbreaking either. That said, it’s definitely the best implementation in the RPG era of the series. Personally, I prefer the old Assassin's Creed combat, where if an attack looked lethal, it actually was lethal in terms of damage. Some people might enjoy the RPG-style combat, and it’s definitely solid for what it is, but I would have liked a toggle for a more classic experience.  

The world design is stunning, easily one of the most beautiful open worlds I’ve seen since Red Dead Redemption 2. However, some areas weren’t designed with Yasuke in mind, which can be frustrating. For example, having to switch to Naoe just to reach certain viewpoints when playing as Yasuke feels like an unnecessary restriction. Sound design is also well done. Some cinematics, especially with the music, give off strong Kill Bill vibes, which is new for the series.  

Progression is solid. A good chunk of side activities reward you with skill points, and they’re quick and easy to complete. They're also conveniently placed, so you’ll naturally come across them while following quests or exploring. While they could get repetitive, the variety helps keep things from feeling like a grind. I suggest that you don't go out of your way to hunt them down, just complete them as you find them and you won’t get bored. As for microtransactions, they don’t really impact progression. I had plenty of resources and in-game money just by playing normally. If you focus too much on grinding for them, you’ll likely ruin your own experience. Just take on enemy camps, contracts, and loot chests as you go, and the pacing will feel great.  

The writing and story are decent, but I wish it had a more linear narrative like the older games. Some dialogue and cutscenes feel a bit stiff, like the voice acting doesn’t always match the mood of the scene. However, the major story cutscenes, particularly in the beginning, during Yasuke and Naoe’s personal arcs, and towards the end, are well-executed. I just wish more of the game’s budget had gone into enhancing the overall quality of the cutscenes and writing.

Bugs have been minimal for me so far. The most noticeable one is that sometimes assassinations don’t fully register, requiring a second or third attempt to finish the enemy off. This only happens about once in a five-hour session, so it hasn’t been game-breaking. Another minor bug I encountered was during the winter, jumping onto a snowy slope occasionally causes Naoe to glitch out and have a mini-seizure, but it’s only happened twice.  

Overall, Shadows is good. The best stealth in the series, great world design, and good progression, but it has a few rough edges. Particularly with combat, RPG mechanics, and storytelling. Some people will love the RPG combat, but as someone who prefers the older games, I found myself wishing for something more traditional.

It’s a solid game. I was skeptical at first during the initial reveal with all the hate and backlash recently, but after experiencing it myself, I was satisfied. My honest rating as a game is 6/10. My rating within the series is a 7.5/10.",True,0,3,1742853721,76561198814819342,3295
191106322,english,"Having played the very first installment of the Assassin’s Creed franchise years ago, I found it to be a rather unremarkable experience - a game that, despite its technical ambition at the time, failed to leave a lasting impression. With the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I was cautiously optimistic and curious to see whether Ubisoft had succeeded in delivering a more compelling entry, especially given the promise of an immersive setting in feudal Japan.

Regrettably, Assassin’s Creed Shadows falls short of the expectations it set for itself. While the marketing heavily emphasized historical authenticity and a deep dive into the aesthetics and ethos of feudal Japan, the final product appears to undermine this very premise. One of the central protagonists - a dark-skinned character who is portrayed in an exaggerated and stylized manner - feels at odds with the historical and cultural context the game claims to represent. While creative liberty is an essential part of artistic expression, in this case it borders on historical revisionism, which may be perceived as misleading by players who were anticipating a faithful depiction of the era. The suggestion that this figure is a samurai - and by extension, part of the imperial lineage - is particularly problematic, especially considering the cultural sensitivity surrounding Japan’s imperial family and its ancestral legacy.

In terms of gameplay, Shadows suffers from a lack of technical polish. Movement is often clunky; actions such as rolls and evasive maneuvers frequently result in the player character getting caught in environmental textures, leading to frustrating and immersion-breaking moments. The graphics, while visually appealing at close range, quickly deteriorate when viewed at greater distances, exposing aggressive optimization techniques that even technologies such as DLSS fail to conceal.

What is perhaps most disappointing is the sense that resources may have been allocated more toward legal and reputational defense than to refining core gameplay or ensuring historical coherence. This misplaced focus has arguably contributed to the game’s underwhelming commercial performance.

To be clear, this criticism is not born out of animosity or prejudice. As a European with deep respect for Japanese culture, I had hoped for a respectful and thoughtfully crafted portrayal of an iconic period in Japanese history. Instead, what we received was a distorted narrative, packaged under the guise of authenticity.

Ultimately, Assassin’s Creed Shadows feels less like a tribute to feudal Japan and more like a missed opportunity - a game whose ambition is undermined by poor execution and a disregard for the expectations it deliberately cultivated.",False,0,0,1742853705,76561198025147350,46

191103082,english,"I'm a pretty big assassins creed fan but the last one that I actually played and enjoyed was Origins. Odyssey was just a Greek game but with assassins creed in the name, and Valhalla was just a viking game with assassins creed in the title. Don't get wrong they were good ancient Greek and Viking games, just not assassins creed games. And Mirage bored me to death with the most annoying main character in the series, Basim. I'm sorry but I couldn't stand him. With that being said, shadows is one of best assassins creed in awhile. I would recommend playing with the language set to Japanese with English subtitles  because the English voice acting is actually horrible. The English version sounds like someone is just reading a piece of paper, but the Japanese version... my god is it so much more immersive. Especially the girl that plays Naoe. The stealth is much better. The game now takes light and noise into account besides just if the enemy sees you or not. It takes some inspiration from the splinter cell series and this is something assassins creed should of had a long time ago. My system is currently less than the recommended and it runs fine. In the towns it can get a little choppy but it doesn't break immersion. If your still on the fence about it, you could just wait for a sale because $70 is a crazy amount, but don't listen to all the people on youtube or even the review section just regurgitating the same complaints every year. Some have valid points, but a lot of people are just wanting to complain. They decided they hated the game before it even came out just because it's not an Elden Ring level game.

The first setting makes the game much more interesting and immersive, the second makes it so the only thing that is ""RPG"" is the open combat, which feels much more correct for an assassins creed game. 

Also we live in a timeline where the Assassins Creed twitter account dunked on Elon Musk. I love it here. Look it up!

I am really surprised how much I like this game! The ninja stealth gives me hardcore Tenchu nostalgia, and the story is reminscent of works by Akira Kurosawa (The original Samurai/Ninja movie guy, whose films were the basis for many western cowboy films [They simply redid the story with guns and outlaws instead of swords and Ronin to appeal to western audiences!]). 


Being based on Akira's works means on the surface it's a revenge story, but there is a depth to the struggles and turmoil the revenge has on the characters. It's weird seeing the reviews saying it's another boring revenge story when even Ghost of Tsushima, if you strip out ALL of the nuance, is just a revenge story. 

The gameplay is fun, the story is not bad, the characters are actually quite memorable and interesting. There is no denying that Uplay is annoying as sin and I can't believe they won't get over that and by proxy make lots more money off the people who refuse to buy their games because of it, but alas, you can't win them all.

I will do a more thourough review after I make it deeper into the game, but I am loving it so far! It's bewildering to me how many people are acting like this game is some woke icon, Yasuke was a real person and assassins creed games have always focused on weird people in weird places when picking their stories. The ""LGBT"" aspect is also not a particularly woke thing since Japan was extremely tolerant of Gay relationships up until westernization in the late 1800s (Samurai having male partners was basically expected, even Nobunaga, the Shogun depicted in the game, was known to have one.)

It's a pity that in this age of comatose people going after the woke that attempts to depict actual history are shot down if that history conflicts with their views. So many of these types want to tie in their movements and beliefs with people like the Samurai because they view them as masculine, powerful, dominating, etc. It just turns out they were also gay as hell, and that obviously can't be tolerated. I highly encourage anyone watching the chaos of this review section play out to do some research, read for yourself. Hell, even the damn Ottomans had a gay culture, just look up Köçeks. This whole idea that LGBT peoples didn't exist up until recently is sort of backwards with reality, gays have existed for a very long time, it's the erasure that is new.",True,0,12,1742849995,76561198039394097,169

The Negatives:
I know im not that far into the game but already I know exactly how Naoe's story is the definition of predictable.  The tutorial is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long made me want to fall asleep I feel like half of the tutorial could have been one long cutscene and I would've liked it more which is saying something because of my next point. The cutscenes are awful. When you spend 70 buckaroos on a triple A game you'd expect the cutscenes to be half decent but they make me literally want to vomit. Any cutscene in this game makes me wish I was blind so I don't have to see the insane lip-sync errors its almost like watching a dubbed movie. Unfortunately I have eyeballs so I guess I'll keep closing them when cutscenes show up. Its a complete night and day difference between cutscenes and then gameplay its actually insane. It's like two different studios made different visuals and one of them was drunk every day. Would it not be easier to do it like the COD Advanced warfare cutscenes?(It would definitely look better) ALSO MICRO TRANSACTIONS IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME THAT COST 70$ WHAT WORLD IS THIS???????? The last negative is that this games publisher is Ubisoft and I think they're probably the worst publisher out there and they ruin everything they touch.

The Positives:
Yasuke's story feels refreshing and in my opinion is pretty good considering all the backlash his character got when the trailers were dropped. I really like how different the playstyle's feel when switching between the two Naoe feels more stealthy and is suppoused to be played like an assassin like the first games while Yasuke is more like assassins cred Valhalla. The visuals during actual game play is nearly breathtaking. I would say the combat is okayish... It's kinda still repetitive, but I just kinda like it. The combat can also feel choppy almost a little stiff sometimes and unfair occasionally. The theme of this game goes so hard samurais and ninjas is f*cking awsome. I havn't ever studied Japanese history so I can't really say if it's realistic or not, but I do enjoy it. Overall the story is good even though it is predictable.

Step 3. ""Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had!""† -Naoe 2025 to Yasuke

Ubisoft marketed this as I could play as either protagonist/fantasy whenever I wanted.

I was allowed the honor of controlling Yasuke for 5 minutes of gameplay, with some cutscenes and on-rails no player input sections.

After that I was forced to play as Naoe for over an hour. I quit and looked up how to swap back to Yasuke. There were articles guides written that claim 10-12 hours of Naoe before I unlock Yasuke again?

This isn't the gameplay freedom I was promised. Controls are just bad. I got stuck sliding down a hill because a bush stopped me but I was still in sliding animation. Controlling the map is ONLY WASD and can't click and drag. Can't attack on your horse and no quick jump off, have to hold a button to dismount. But let us praise Ubi for auto mounting? I set a waymarker and turned on the guide line and it never showed up and a minute later it turned off with a message I didn't get to read completely. 

Hope the Gooney's kid wasn't written by Ubisoft's historian that likes writing about priests and little boys.

Now this is kind of a personal gripe with a coast I'm familiar with, I didn't expect anything from Ubi and I'm still dissapointed. The city of Obama is relatively well laid out but sadly they didn't bother modeling any of the cool ""cave"" pass through natural arches on the shores or even anything nice to look at west of Wakasa and most of the shoreline is just steep forested cliffs where it should be much flatter. They chose to make an open world but left so much empty space with not even the real life cool things to look at. Obviously it isn't a 1:1 scale of Japan and I don't expect that. There was a single Kofun on a little island that could have been these pretty pass through arcs that litter that coastline but no, copy paste a Kofun.

Other games like Kingdom Come have large empty areas of forest or whatever and they put in LIFE. A micro story of a skeleton holding a bag, caved in mines, ""accidents"" that are usually always murders. But for Japan they could have opened google maps and modeled natural sight seeing locations, or done ANYTHING to give the empty space life or a reason to be there.

191100837,english,"Not worth 80$. A little background I've been an Assassins Creed Fan since the beginning my favorite memory is receiving a collectors 360 edition for Black Flag as that was pretty much as good as Assassins creed got. I have played every single title up until Odyssey not because the game design wasn't ""Assassins Creed"" but because the design is just terrible in general. After Odyssey I refused to play Valhalla and Mirage but always had a soft spot for the Edo Period so I wanted to give the creed title one last shot. 

With as many hours as I've played truly giving Ubisoft a fair shake I can say that they robbed me of 80 dollars for another cash grab. Everything is the exact same where I left things with Odyssey, allow me to break it down. 

1. Let's get this out of the way. The game can be beautiful. You don't really need IGN or any nonsensical reviewer to tell you that the world is vast and colorful, and then go on a 15 minute tangent on how realistic the weather is. I'm gonna stop that right here. Polish a turd and its still a turd. 
2. The game is boring. Creed has made it very obvious that character writing and plot development is not their best interest so no matter where you are in the story there has been nothing to put me on the edge of my seat or any character flaws or development for me to interest me into playing. 
3. Look alive my fellow gamer. Bigger, does not mean better. Black Flag did it right. They gave a vast selection of different locations with real navigation with immersive activities to do. In Shadows you can collect scrolls? Pray at shrines? Repetitive Contracts? Doing a side by side comparison you can tell when there is real creative freedom and when there is not as Shadows failed to deliver anything that memorable besides senseless hours of discovering what felt like the same thing over and over.

I could honestly keep going on and on to how why I think Ubisoft is basing their game designs off an AI but I will leave you with this. Do NOT waste your money on this.

This game has a free for now battlepass and a store stocked to the level of fortnite with armor, cosmetics for your hideout and items that help speed up the game. It's not as bad as Odyssey in the p2w aspect because this game goes faster, but wtf man. 

The store on day 1 for a $70 game is criminal. It's disgusting. The coolest armor sets in the game with the most time spent on them are no doubt the store items and it's not even close. These also have perks that make the game easy mode. If you wanna have those perks as paid items, fine. But at least have the cosmetics earnable in some way. 

The armor bundles equal about $20 in real money each. The bundles that give you some resources equal about $10 and that might be the most criminal part of the store because that might get you 1 upgrade on a single building out of the 3 levels available at a hideout.

191099878,english,"If you’ve never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an excellent place to start. This new game in the series brings fresh ideas while keeping the things fans love, making it perfect for both newcomers and long-time players.

Set in feudal Japan, Assassin’s Creed Shadows lets you explore beautiful, detailed environments like ancient temples, bustling villages, and peaceful forests. The world feels alive, and there’s always something exciting to discover as you wander around. Whether you’re climbing rooftops or sneaking through the woods, the world is rich and fun to explore.

One of the coolest features of this game is the two main characters you get to play as. You can control Naoe, a stealthy ninja, and Yasuke, a powerful samurai. This gives you two very different playstyles—stealthy and sneaky with Naoe, or strong and bold with Yasuke. It’s great because you can choose how you want to approach the game, depending on what you enjoy more.

The story is exciting too. At its heart, it’s a tale of revenge and justice, but it also dives into themes of loyalty and identity. The characters are well-written and the voice acting is fantastic, making you feel connected to the journey of both Naoe and Yasuke. It’s a story that will keep you hooked from start to finish.

If you like to take your time and explore, you’ll love the many side activities the game offers. You can do things like participate in tea ceremonies, explore hidden areas, or just take in the sights and sounds of the world around you. Even the smaller tasks are fun, adding a lot of depth to the game.

The combat is smooth and enjoyable. Whether you’re sneaking up on enemies and using stealthy moves as Naoe or charging into battle with Yasuke’s sword, every fight feels satisfying. Plus, you can customize your characters and abilities, making each playthrough feel unique.

Visually, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is stunning. The game looks incredible, with gorgeous landscapes and realistic character designs that make it feel like you’re living in Japan’s past. Whether you’re on the move or stopping to admire the view, the game’s visuals are sure to impress.

Overall, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a fantastic game that’s easy to pick up and play, but still offers plenty of depth for those who want to dive deeper. If you’re new to the Assassin’s Creed series, this is a great starting point, and if you’re a fan of the franchise, you’ll definitely find something to love. It’s an exciting adventure that’s fun, engaging, and visually stunning.",True,0,0,1742847589,76561198046109178,2700

now to my actual review:
after playing mirage and 100% it i loved it i thought i was peak ac like we're so back type shit
but ac mirage kinda falls apart when it comes to the story there really isnt much happening with basim u just do whatever ur told ur roshans goodboy :3 which is fine it was what classic ac was all about u go around assassinate targets and not ask questions u follow whatever ur master tells u
and just like altair in ac1, basim also deifys that closer to the end of the game and reshapes the creed etc etc

now with ac shadows it feels more like the ezio trilogy in terms of story u are on a revenge mission to hunt down ur fathers killers and it is amazing the intro to the game and how they reveal the villains in this is so fucking cool i loved every second of it will update this after i beat the game! :3

now for some pros:
-best combat in the series 
-best stealth in the series
-best cutscenes 
-the voice acting is peak
-the difficulty settings and the ability to literally either turn this into an rpg or a classic ac game (on par with ghost recon breakpoint if not better)
-i love how fast the horse is unlike mirage 
-i love the drip so many options
-love the weapon verity 
-love the graphics

So far at 40 hours
Pros:  One of the best looking worlds ive ever seen in a game and has the greatest weather effects ive ever seen.
Combat is fun with Naoe and she feels like more of a classic AC stealth character. Finishing moves are awesome and brutal. Ghosts still has better combat overall but this one is still fun.
Im one of the few actually enjoying the main quest and Naoe's story. It can be a bit dry in some parts (and a few corny lines) but overall its kept me engaged.
The hideout building is fun and doesnt feel like a drag on the game to grind materials or anything.

Cons:
Progression is busted and as early as level 10 I was in full legendaries which removes any reason to find new loot or gear other then the look of it.
Yasuke could have just been an NPC in cut scenes, I have no desire to play him as he is way over powered and boring to play. This could change later as I try him out more.
Overall not too many bugs, but the reviving assassinated NPC is annoying.
They copied a lot of idea from GoT and it shows. I love GoT so that's not a bad thing but ya they copied a lot of their game mechanics and activities.

Ill add more as I go but for now Id give it a 8, essentially more AC RPG. If you liked Origin/Ody/Valh  then you will like this.",True,0,2,1742842577,76561198023171292,4642
191093967,english,"OK, the game is amazing. It's easily my second favorite AC game. I was extremely hesitant to buy it after the total fiasco that was Star Wars Outlaws - easily, the least creative game to come from Ubisoft, and I've played most of their games. I had no idea it was possible to make a Star Wars game that boring and featuring zero interesting gameplay elements. 

In AC: Shadows, literally everything is perfect - I love the setting, I love the performance, I love the visuals, I am vibing with the music, I am hooked on the story. But... the game has a very good amount of cutscenes, and I am loving that. Yet, Ubisoft have decided to lock these cutscenes to 30 FPS. I was more or less fine with it in Far Cry 6, as the cutscenes were almost irrelevant and few there, but here... It's atrocious. It's 2025, the game runs on my rig at over 120 FPS with all settings on ultra but is interlaced with sluggish, painful to watch cutscenes running at 30 FPS. Yes, the cutscenes are more detailed than the rest of the game, but they also have a locked camera movement. No, 30 FPS is not cinematic, this is a game and not a movie. When the action jumps from 120 FPS to 30 FPS - it's nauseating.

I know there is a convoluted third-party workaround that unlocks the framerate in the cutscenes, but I want to see this addressed and fixed by Ubisoft. Yes, fixed, because it's a fixable problem. If the company thinks that someone likes their cutscenes at 30 FPS, make it an option.

As soon as the cutscenes are unlocked, I will put change this review to positive. Please, please, please, do it. You have almost redeemed yourself, Ubisoft. So close!",False,0,3,1742842288,76561197982529437,1471

Beautiful
The leveling/gear system is simple and fun, feels exciting to unlock something new that changes the combat

191093264,english,"Assassin’s Creed Shadows refines the RPG formula, bringing meaningful improvements while keeping the core AC experience intact.

Pros:
✔ Stunning visuals & immersive world – Feudal Japan feels alive, with realistic lighting, detailed landscapes, and dynamic environments.
✔ Stealth is finally viable – Shadows actually work, making infiltration feel rewarding rather than frustrating.
✔ Engaging combat system – A big step up from previous RPG titles, though it takes some time to master. Enemies are aggressive, making fights more intense.
✔ Dual protagonists with distinct playstyles – Naoe excels in agility and stealth, while Yasuke is a powerhouse in combat, offering different ways to play.
✔ Better pacing & progression – Fewer fetch quests, more meaningful side activities like hideout building.

Cons:
✖ Combat leans too much into Souls-like mechanics – While improved, some may find parry-based fights out of place in AC’s traditionally fluid combat.
✖ Character balance issues – Yasuke’s lack of parkour and stealth skills make Naoe the more practical choice for most gameplay scenarios.
✖ Some minor AI bugs – Enemies occasionally fail to detect you when they should, but nothing game-breaking.

Verdict:
Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a strong entry that builds on the RPG formula while addressing past issues. It’s not without flaws, but it’s the best and most gorgeous AC RPG to date.

There is so much to say about this game but I will say one thing to start off - I haven't enjoyed an Assassin's Creed game this much since Black Flag.

I bought this game on day 1 release and ignored all the online reviews. I'm playing on GeForce Now and have all the pretty settings on. I took my time with the missions and explored the entire first area before moving on to the next geographical location. This game sucked me in immediately. I also turned on full immersion so it feels like I'm watching a show while also playing an Assassin's Creed game. The main quests and side quests feel natural and it truly feels like I'm in 16th century Japan. I have even spent time to read the codex pages (which I never do because they are so boring). In this game they actually feel relevant and provide historical context (and spoilers) of all the major historical figures. 

The gameplay, for me, is great without being too difficult. I never enjoyed the Dark Souls type games. This allows me to enjoy the pacing while also offering enough in the arsenal that I can't just press one button. I personally enjoy the option of choosing between 2 characters for most missions and area unlocks. They each provide unique strengths depending on the location.

191089708,english,"Because I'm not a culture war loser, or an AC purist who conveniently forgets the countless times where historically accurate characters didn't do historically accurate things (looking at you, Ezio and the Pope), I enjoy the game quite a bit. The ""not being able to assassinate everyone"" issue doesn't exist for me, because guess what? I like having a point to the progression of skills in my rpg games, so I'm okay with the challenge of having to finish my kills off with open combat. 

Speaking of which, combat is fun with both characters, though I do favor (surprise) the assassin. Yasuke, however, is great for when I just feel like mowing through crowds of enemies and taking their heads for trying to stand in my way. I will make a point of saying that all weapon types feel uniquely fun to mix and match, with varied enough perks to diversify builds.

The world is stunning, with plenty of places to explore, loot, and traverse, albeit with only a few instances of feeling ""empty"". This largely occurred when traversing between larger settlements, but it only barely diminished the impressive scope and vibrance of the map.

The voice acting isn't a strong suit, I'll admit. The immersive mode is a step up imho.

Story-wise (from what I played so far), it's not gonna blow you away, but to me, it's compelling enough to justify why I'm going to assassinate all of these different people and interacting with the various cast of characters.

Overall, I think AC Shadows scratches the itch that was exacerbated by the previous entries that would be considered better games had they existed outside of this franchise. It has enough of what I consider to be the ""AC Formula"" to be worth your time if you enjoyed the gameplay of entries prior to AC Origins, especially considering the various improvements they've added to the experience (namely the ability to go prone and the addition of lighting mattering for stealth), but it's up to you to decide how much that time is worth to you when it comes to pricing. Personally, I have big boy money, so I'm not bothered paying full price.

191086060,english,"I'd give it a Mixed rating if I could, but in the lack of such an option, I'd still lean very slightly towards Recommend.

The world is absolutely phenomenal, pretty much one of the best looking games out there today. The recreation of feudal Japan is truly amazing, and just walking around the world with the HUD turned off is an experience.

Other than that it's a very mixed bag. It is very bread and butter Assassin's Creed, so if you know what that's like you know exactly what you're getting. The open world activities are very bland and copy and paste, the combat is passable but very simple. The AI is way too simple for the stealth to offer much of a challenge. The story is very bare bones and the writing ranges from passable to laughably bad. 

Naoe is a good character and has a lot of potential as a protagonist. Her gameplay and tools are also very fun and fit the feudal Japan ninja fantasy very well. Yasuke is also a fine character, though I think he would've worked much better as a side character NPC. His gameplay just does not fit Assassin's Creed at all. He is the polar opposite of an assassin, and on top of that he is insanely overtuned at least on release, making the game even on the hardest settings so easy it becomes a slog to play. I think this game would've benefited a lot from having just Naoe as a single protagonist.

If you're looking for a VERY beautiful open world rendition of feudal Japan to just wander around for a while, and are looking for that very familiar Ubisoft slop Assassin's Creed gameplay, I'd definitely recommend this. But if you're looking for more depth from the gameplay and especially story side, I'd get something like Ghost of Tsushima.",True,0,0,1742836061,76561198069601045,3427

Naoe is incredibly fun. She is super fast, and it is very enjoyable to run around even without doing anything specific.

191084365,english,"At first glance the game is awesome. You are lured in by these cinematic kills that feel satisfying and impressive. There is somewhat of a story, and you get drawn into this beautiful landscape that makes you want to explore.

Unfortunately as you progress into the game, the veil starts to lift as you realize this beautiful world is lifeless. Sure there are NPCs, villages, and wildlife that gives the illusion of life, BUT it becomes apparent that they aren't really doing anything or even have any dialogue. After playing a game like KCD2 that is so FULL of life, this game feels empty, and as I realized this, it kind of ruined the game for me. It seems like they forced the FOV to be so close, so you wouldn't notice these things. At Viewpoints overlooking towns, such as in castles, you really notice these things.

I also found myself wishing for a lot more. I feel very limited as a player. Why can't I pilot other ships? I am forced to the little boat. Why can't I climb onto a boat and kill the driver NPC who smashed into me and capsized my boat? Why can't I do something as simple as killing a deer in the forest? It could thematically make sense if the game wasn't literally a game about killing. I understand the morality and the theory that I am ""moral"" assassin and whatnot, but I just feel myself wanting more.

Do I recommend the game? 

I am putting NO because for $70 I do not think it's worth it. It has moments where it can be fun, and the story is decent, but for the number of flaws and restrictions forced onto the player, I think it would be best to wait for a sale. If money is no issue to you - it would hold your attention for a bit, but ultimately I think you will feel a lot of the same things I did.

[u]-Graphics[/u]
Beautiful. Best graphics I've seen in a game to date. Mind melting.

[u]-Gameplay[/u]
Extremely fun gameplay loop. Straight up the best assasin's creed has ever felt

[u]-Introduction[/u]
Super engaging intro. The first 10 hours of story is well written and has a great hook. After that, the gameplay kept me playing until the end.

[u]-Side-Quests[/u]
Good side-quests. Not witcher 3 writing by any means, but fun jaunts through the world.



[b]CONS:[/b]
[u]-Story: [/u]

Just for context, here's how the story progresses, relatively:

1 hr prologue of both Yasuke and Naoe
Great intro, super fun, shows off their respective kits well.

8hr Act 1 Naoe only
Great opening act, solid writing, and solid quest design that keeps you engaged.

30hr ACt 2 Naoe + Yasuke
Grind time. You're set loose to kill 12ish story bosses, along with all of the open world content to improve your weapons, level, and skills. Typical looter rpg midgame.

1hr Naoe Final Act
[spoiler]It sets up a giant plot thread for Naoe just to tell you to go fuck yourself. (they hint that her mom is alive, and at this point I was like, 'alright, where the fuck is she, lets go find her!'... straight to fucking end credits.) Seriously?[/spoiler]

4hr Yasuke Final Act
[spoiler]Yasuke's story thread sucks albeit for different reasons. They save his backstory for the very end of the game, give it to you right before the final boss, and then his story is over. Is it crazy to think that that cutscene should've been at the start of the game? Like that is the only relevant piece of information we get about him since the start of the game, during his 20 min intro. Overall though, he's the only character who actually gets an arc, and although cliche, its ok storytelling.[/spoiler]

10 min Epilogue
[spoiler]The story set so much up just to leave so many threads hanging. Then, they dangle the epilogue in your face of them looking at the sunset like, 'theres so much more of our journey to come...'. Like fucking where? Because I damn well know that Ubisoft is kinda fucked right now, and this might have been their only chance 
to tell the whole story.[/spoiler]

I didn't realize I had just played the epilogue until i double-checked steam that I got the achievement. It was so fucking lackluster. Writers basically said, 'Here's a cool red costume, fuck off.'

Compared to valhalla, the story (quality and length), bosses, and gear progression are sub-par, while the gameplay, graphics, and setting are so much better.

ANIMUS
[spoiler]Don't even get me fucking started. They set it up at the start to be some kinda mystery, just for it to be 4, 5-min narration segments sprinkled through the whole game. No stepping out of the animus, no underlying modern day assasin / templar storyline. Just 20 min of incomprehensible filler dialogue to make it seem mysterious.[/spoiler]

END OF SPOILERS

[u]-Challenge[/u]
If you know how percentages and multipliers work, you can craft a ggez build so quick. On the hardest difficulty, I really didn't struggle much with either character. This is also kind of an issue, because Naoe is designed to do less damage and have less health, which is supposed to make her worse for melee combat...except with a good build she can be on-par or even better than Yasuke. 

On top of that, Naoe's assasin kit  is way more fun than Yasuke's. Naoe is fast, fluid, and can kill enemies just as fast as Yasuke, albeit with a bit less health, and if you spec her skills / gear correctly. Yasuke is just clunky. Once you build a kit that feels comfortable (takes like an hour), he just becomes a left click simulator. The stealth AI is way more engaging and well tuned than the melee AI. There aren't any unique bosses or mechanics. No valkyries or mythical beasts like in valhalla. I get that they were aiming for a more grounded tone, but that should not detract from unique, engaging encounters. It's a straight up downgrade from valhalla.

[u]-Lastly...[/u]
Something feels missing...in Valhalla, there were extra mysteries to chase and endgame bosses to fight. After such a terrible ending in Shadows, I was hoping for more. Something akin to gungnir, excalibur, mjolnir, and the thor armor set from valhalla wouldve been awesome, especially after ending on such a sour note. But nope, thats it. Finish the rest of the mini bosses, castles, and side-quests, then game over.

The game is not historically accurate: AC has never been, so if the concept of a black samurai makes you clutch your pearls, well, you weren't going to get the game anyway.

The game takes massive inspiration from Kill Bill, which is awesome. It is an absolutely gorgeous game as well. Seasons pass and you can watch snow melt, autumn leaves build up, trees bloom, and all that good stuff. The world feels very lived-in and alive.

Icing on the cake? The game runs like a DREAM. Yeah, surprising considering the state of AAA games nowadays looking no different from 2016 but requiring DLSS and Frame Gen. I hear it also runs at a capped 30FPS on the Deck, but I'd probably go looking for videos of that or something before investing.

The base building is A+. You can design the layout, upgrades, and looks of your own ninja hideout. This includes customizing exteriors and interior decorations as well to an extent.

The differing gameplays between Naoe and Yasuke really keep things interesting (and you can stick with one or the other if you prefer stealth or slaughter), and the story is dense so far and has me interested. The NPCs weren't as ""quirky"" so far as Valhalla's were, so I appreciate some semblance of a serious story. Naoe is your typical assassin: the inclusion of crawling on the ground, her weapons changing up her assassinations, and deeper stealth gameplay make her fun when your plan goes off without a hitch. Yasuke is there for when everything needs to die and you don't care if your enemies can see and hear you coming for their heads from a mile away. Does that mean Naoe can't fight? Not at all: Combat with her is seriously fun too, but she's squishier and you need to be a bit more methodical with your killing. 

Unfortunately, I've come across quite a few bugs. Assassinating an enemy only for him to get back up and pretend nothing ever happened.

Some footsoldier puking and coughing in place, I decide to deliver his COVID shot straight to the jugular and hide his ass in some hay...only to watch another, healthy footsoldier to take the previous one's spot and IMMEDIATELY start puking and coughing. I guess there's some sort of AI trigger for ""Anyone Standing Here Contracts AIDs"".

Don't forget the game comes with the Ubisoft special of microtransactions. You can buy gear for your characters, cosmetics for the NPCs in your personal Konoha village, cosmetics for your mounts, cosmetics for your base, etc. I just ignore them.

Gameplay is nice, graphics is good. But it ends there. History is a cliché and is extremely boring. It is an enormous waste of a chance of making an incredible ninja assassin. The main characters are shallow and of mild personality.

The world environment is vague and almost doesn´t exist. Citizens, daily activities, people talking, living their lives. There is so few of that so you are not a shadow among the crowd. Exactly the opposite of the AC franchise, with all the previous remarkable characters (even NPCs were of strong attitude).

Thinking this way, this is more likely a generic open world game than an AC, since you don´t have even the Creed, the templars/alike conspiracy trying to control the world with the help of Isu relics and all that about.

However, that does not make the English VO bad. Go back and watch AC2 dialogue, you'll hear the same level of 'terrible' accents there. its not until Brotherhood/Revelations where they toned this down.

If you are really bothered by this. Play the JP VO, however if you can not be bothered to read 30-40 hours of dialogue, you'll be fine with the English VO.

The fighting and the stealth gameplay are ok.

Naoe's gameplay is stealth, the AI is a bit dumb, they cannot climb on roofs, they forget you very quickly.

Yasuke's gameplay is samurao fightings, which means you have to fight a horde of enemies, dodging, parrying and it quickly can become messy.

I play it on hardest difficulty and also ""Immersive"" mode (Japanese/Portuguese Voice Acting).

Also with the ""unquided"" mode, which means you don't have a marker which tells you where you target is. Like a detective, you need to follow clues and use ""Scouts"" to narrow down your targets location, this kinda drags the game longer.

[h3][b]Settings & Customization[/b][/h3]
There are a ton of options in the settings. One cool feature is the [b]non-guaranteed assassinations[/b] for elites—you normally have to level up skills to assassinate tougher enemies, but if you don’t want that progression, there’s a toggle to make it like the classic AC games where all assassinations are guaranteed.

[h3][b]Graphics & World[/b][/h3]
The game looks [b]incredible[/b]. The lighting, environments, and details are all top-tier. Just like past AC games, exploring historical sites, this time in Japan, is a highlight.

The previous game, Mirage, had the best map with Baghdad being dense, intricate, and majestic. That feeling of entering Baghdad I have yet to find here. Exploring something like Osaka Castle is great but not on that level.

[h3][b]Immersive Mode vs. English Dub[/b][/h3]
I’m playing in English, but there’s an [b]Immersive Mode[/b] that locks voices to historical languages—Japanese and Portuguese—so you can play with full authenticity if you want.

[h3][b]Gameplay & Stealth[/b][/h3]
This is the [b]best stealth AC has ever had[/b]. It just feels right—smooth movement, better hiding mechanics, and solid assassinations. Combat is different from both classic AC and the RPG-style games since [b]Origins[/b], I've liked all iterations, as well as this one.

[h3][b]Dual Protagonists[/b][/h3]
The [b]dual protagonist system[/b] is way better than in [b]AC Syndicate[/b]. Naoe and Yasuke feel completely different, both in their stories and the way they play.

[list]
	[*] [b]Naoe[/b] is [b]fast[/b]—you feel it in her combat, running speed, and parkour.
	[*] [b]Yasuke[/b] is [b]strong[/b]—his attacks hit like a truck, he smashes through obstacles instead of smoothly climbing, and he moves with real weight.

I bought it despite hearing numerous voices—both in my head and online—telling me not to, mainly because of Ubisoft’s questionable business practices and the recent wave of lackluster and soulless releases from the company. But the feudal Japan theme was just too tempting to pass up.

THE GAME IS GOOD.

Is it as deep and complex as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? ABSOLUTELY NOT.
The plot isn’t groundbreaking, but it’s solid. The Animus and futuristic elements have been minimized, and you can easily ignore them if you want to.

Is it fun? YES. A lot.
And it’s simple. Quick to pick up and play. Beautiful to look at.
It’s the kind of game you want to launch when you’re in the mood to relax and unwind for hours without overthinking anything.

The internet is still a place filled with negativity, and it seems like some YouTubers profit off of it. I get why people have soured on Ubisoft in recent years, but this particular game is enjoyable.
The pay-to-win cosmetics are there, but they’re hidden well in a sub-menu that’s easy to avoid. As for the Yasuke storyline, it’s based on real historical facts that were already available online before the game was even announced. So, I really don’t understand the baseless hate.

This game is receiving a lot of hate simply because it’s from Ubisoft, but let's be honest – the game is pretty amazing. The graphics are stunning, easily a 10/10. The story keeps you engaged and has great potential. The parkour and stealth mechanics are spot on. Yes, the game does have bugs, but that's typical for any game – it doesn’t make it the worst. Overall, it’s a solid game.

A lot of people are upset about the microtransactions, but they've been part of Ubisoft games for a while. The good news is you don't need to spend money to enjoy the game. The microtransactions are mostly for cosmetics and are pretty much useless in terms of gameplay. The battle pass is a bit of a letdown, but you don't have to pay for it – just enjoy the free rewards.

It has been so long since a single-player game has completely hooked me from the very beginning, but Assassin’s Creed Shadows did just that—and then some. The sheer attention to detail, the fluidity of the combat, and the depth of its world make this one of the best Assassin’s Creed experiences I’ve ever played.

One of the first things I did was switch the audio to Japanese, and that instantly took the immersion to another level. It feels like stepping into a high-budget samurai film, where every conversation, every clash of swords, and every quiet moment carries so much weight. The world breathes with authenticity, making exploration just as rewarding as the action-packed missions.

The dual protagonist system is another standout feature. Even though I’ve only scratched the surface with both Naoe and Yasuke, I’m already loving how different they feel to play. Whether I’m striking from the shadows or engaging in brutal combat, everything feels smooth and satisfying.

I haven’t felt this excited about a single-player game since Red Dead Redemption 2. One moment that truly left an impression was a particular cinematic scene between Naoe and her father (no spoilers). It felt like something straight out of an Avengers movie—intense, emotional, and beautifully directed. It also reminded me of one of my all-time favorite films, Seven Samurai, with the stunning visuals and artistry reminiscent of Kurosawa’s legendary work.

I played on Immersive Mode, Expert Stealth/Combat and around 130fps on 4070Ti & 13600k on Ultra with the highest ray tracing.

To any person - I will always recommend the 'Immersive Mode'.
It's WAY better, the acting is way more emotional and every scene feels like a new interpretation in compare to the original eng dub, which I think is lacking.

I also think the best AI experience can be served by playing on expert difficulty for expert/combat.
Ignore youtube grifters making videos about this game on the lowest possible difficulty, where ai tends to behave like a bunch of apes from games made for 6yo kids.

Can't say how many times I had to stop running to make a few screens, because I was so charmed.

As for this day, it's definitely the most beautiful game I've played.

The storyline is pretty similar to any previous AC game - A story about revenge and special 'artefacts'. 
If you liked previous story, then you're definitely not gonna mind the current one, but If you're a person who didn't like it in the past, then you're most likely not gonna like it this time.

I feel like the vanilla version is really a preparation for the bigger expansion, because there's a lot of untold stories.

Naoe & Yasuke are both insanely likeable and understandable when it comes to their choices.

Naoe is the main assasin, while Yasuke is her partner in crime.
She's definitely the smallest protagonist we've ever had and also the most deadly and agile. 
I had a lot of fun playing as her, even tho she's not as charismatic as Ezio, Edward, Arno or Bayek. 
Ig it's just the vision of showing the story in that period, where people were a bit more introverted.(my PoV)

Ubisoft's interpretation of Yasuke as a samurai based on a really small portion of historical information is actually written interesting way and It feels like their vision is consistent with confirmed historical facts about him and emphasizes Yasuke's good upbringing and humility

Side characters are likeable and memorable, #junjiro_is_the_goat

The open world is beautiful, alive and there's a lot of stuff to do.(tho, two activities like meditation and weapon training are repetitive over time), unlike in the most compared game to Shadows - GoT, where the world was just beautiful thanks to the grass & folliage, insanely empty, copy pasted with pretty much 0 stuff to do, outside for the main campaign, killing a single group of bandits and some lazy quests for side characters.

Worth mentioning - side quests and activities in Shadows are much better condensed than in previous games in the series, so the player does not feel overwhelmed.

Audio is as always - unmatched in Ubisoft games.
Beautiful soundtrack, matching the atmosphere of the game.
I really like the one during stealth, when there's a calm music with Naoe's whispers.

I'm not the target of such changes, but the overall accessibility for people who prefere different control presents or have been dealing with different disabilities - it's just impressive and I feel like it deserves a note, because not many people talk about it, not many developers take care of it, but many people might benefit from it.

To me it's definitely 8/10 game, while being +10/10(GOD TIER) graphics/audio wise.

At the moment of writing this review, it's been a week since the game released and well... there are bugs.

Sometimes a random cat gets stuck on the wall, some very specific bandits in very specific locations require 3x stealth assasinations to get killed, audio did get delayed a few times and well - there are very typical Assasin's Creed's movement inaccuracies that every fan of series has known ever since the game was released.

I do really believe tho such a small stuff would get fixed asap as I remember the release day of Mirage and it got fixed,

The part that I'm not completely a fan of is the combat.
It's no different than any other AC:RPG game or let's say Witcher3, or even Elden Ring(except for difficulty ofc), but in this game - If you have some upgrades to your weapon like bleeding/poison then well... an enemy isn't gonna do much against you, because of being stuned or in a 'vulnerable' state, so in late game the game becomes too easy.

If you liked the combat from Witcher3 or let's say Origins/Valhalla/Odyssey then you're gonna be fine.
Tho, I'm aware many people would expect something different and it'd be a deal breaker for them.

I completely do not recommend listening to the opinions of haters, grifters or people trying to push stupid agendas on everything, while also totally changing the marketing words of Ubisoft and sharing fake articles's titles to gather some views thanks to the questionable state of company and their bigger/lesser bloopers.

The game is literally one of the best Ubisoft has made in recent years and it's definitely one of the strongest Assasin's Creed games in a series.

If you can't wait and can afford it for the full price - Get it right now.
If you can't afford it right now, get it on Ubisoft Connect with 20% off with tokens.
If you want to wait, definitely get it on a discount.

I bought the Deluxe Edition and with over 80h of playtime, I made my money absolutely worth it.
I know I will be playing it from time to time to finish some additional content that I haven't finished yet, lol. 
I got at least +10h left of stuff to do.

In terms of pure side content: caves are boring as hell, so is ""painting"" animals, and shrines destroy any pacing the story has.

There's also 0 reactivity. I had a shrine quest where I was supposed to sneak into a garrison to confirm it was taken over by the enemy. Except I just went in and killed everyone. I go back to the quest giver with no dialogue option for confirming I killed everyone, and then he says: ""Good, today you learned a valuable lesson in observation"".

191067389,english,"I'm honestly shocked with the amount of hate this one is getting. I am a huge hater of the RPG style of Assassin's Creed games and would much rather eat needles than play Origins. This one was just too enticing not to at least try. I usually just pirate games like this because I don't think companies like this deserve any money, but I gave it the 2 hours before I needed to refund and was just too curious to see what the hate was about. In my opinion, this is miles better than anything that they have released in the past 10 years. Visually, this game is stunning, and I could see the performance issues lower-end machines could have running this game, but I don't see any negative performance reviews. 

The combat is SO much better than Origins and Odyssey's boring-ass health bar combat. The writing is actually one of the worst things I have ever seen in my life, and the voice actors for the English are actually comical; it is so bad. I really like a lot of Ubisoft's older titles, and I personally think that Ubi is one of the worst AAA publishers there is, but I have been finding a lot of enjoyment from this title. If you are like me and actually despise the rpg bs assassinations, there is a goat feature that just allows you to have fun in the game. I haven't even touched on the character design in the game yet, but a lot of people are pissed at there being two characters. Gta had 3 characters with 3 unique traits and different missions you had to do for each of them, and no one is pissed there? Now don't get me wrong, this game will never and is not holding a candle to gta. This game is actually nothing, and it is embarrassing to even price this game like this at 70 dollars compared to a 12-year-old game like gta, but my point is that you simply don't have to play Yasuke in this game. There are so many reviews saying that you should play as one character, but who cares? I didn't even unlock the choice to play him until I hit like 20 hours in the game because I was having so much fun playing as the small assassin character that most of us want to play as. Yasuke is a fantastic character in this game for people who hate playing stealth and love the rpg style that Ubisoft is so painstakingly still going for. 

I think the gameplay is fine, boring, for what I am assuming is most of the population on this earth, but I love the classic Ubisoft Far Cry style of taking camps; it is simply my favorite thing about those games. Like, I actually spent the first 15 hours of this game just taking camps and accidentally assassinating important targets because they were in that camp. Again, Ubisoft is going through the approach of the non-guided system by default, and I was hesitant to not turn on guided mode. I have actually really enjoyed the little hints, unlike in Odyssey. Odyssey is so big that I just wanted to play the game instead of doing a mouse chase to maybe find what I am looking for. It doesn't feel like that in this game; I think it improves the experience of the game, unlike not being able to assassinate people because I haven't jerked the right people for 30 hours in this game to be able to kill someone that is 1 level ahead of me. The stealth in this game is really good; is it like the classic titles? Not even close, but for this rpg style I think it doesn't get better than this. The actual fighting is solid, not the classic attack parry that I hold so dearly, but it does its job. Yasuke just brings the fighting to a whole other level to the point where it doesn't even feel fair. You choose this character if you just want to scrap with little to no resistance from most enemies in this game. All of the weapon choices in this game feel pretty good too. 

I really haven't had any crazy bugs happen to me in my time playing either. The one I see all of the time is when you assassinate an enemy that is lying down; there is a chance that he just respawns instantly and is just confused why you just killed him. It hasn't ruined any stealth encounters in this game, mostly because the stealth in this game is so forgiving. The Skyrim level of AI is honestly quite sad to see in a game like this; it gets to a point where you just don't even think of them as a threat because you can just run away and they just forget about you in 10 seconds if you lose line of sight. Makes the game feel more soulless than it needs to, in my opinion.

Now the microtransactions are so funny to me. I hated them in Odyssey mostly because the level grind in that game is so insufferable, and you needed to spend money to level up faster in that game. The microtransactions in this game are just here to be here. It can piss people off as much as it wants, but it is truly just something you could never see in your playthrough if you never click the store tab. Yes, it is strange that on such an expensive game all of the content isn't available, but what do you expect? Ubisoft is not a good company anymore.

Now do I recommend this game? Yeah. Do I recommend this game at 70 dollars? No. This will just be another Ubisoft game that is simply forgotten and only played on a 10-dollar sale like usual. Ubisoft has not changed, and I do think they are too far gone to ever come back. If I wanted to play this game, I would wait until it is at least 30 dollars.

191065548,english,"With almost 40 hours in the game and having only finished Act 1, it's even better than I would have hoped. A wonderful setting with beautiful scenery, fun combat and stealth, and a story that is both full of twists and turns while also giving us an interesting insight into the history of Feudal Japan. Assassin's Creed games have never been renowned for their storytelling when in comparison to their game play, but I've been pleasantly surprised so far and am invested in seeing how things will play out.

Playing as Naoe versus playing as Yasuke is like night and day (literally). I've always preferred being a stealthy assassin in any games I can literally be one, so I was surprised to find myself really enjoying the more aggressive game play of a Samurai as Yasuke; while I prefer Naoe just from the Ninja aspect of things (and me being a nerd), deciding to say ""f-ck it we ball"" and just slaughtering an enemy camp in broad daylight without breaking a sweat is a fun change of pace.

I have a few pros and cons I want to highlight.

Pros:
- Fun, fluid and varied game play where you can pick whichever character suits your fancy. I've seen people say they try to play Yasuke during the day and Naoe during the night which sounds great and plays into their strengths.
- All armor sets and weapons look fantastic. I'm very impressed with both the authenticity and the creativity with the armor sets especially. Also, you can unlock transmog through the Forge in the Hideout which is always a big must.
- The world is beautiful. The seasons changing in real time is a wonder to behold, and I've found myself trying not to fast travel so I get an excuse to run around on my horse (which there are sooo many different ones, with customisation options for different saddles which is just a neat bonus).
- Stealth feels really good and rewarding. I play on normal because I am a pleb but lots of people seem to be playing on Expert Stealth which means not even roofs are safe... tread carefully.
- The hideout is a perfect mix of form and function, Animal Crossing and Aesthetic Goals™. Even my husband, who often complains about player hubs or goes out of his way to not visit them, has spent copious amount of hours decorating it. Also, PETS. Pet all the damn animals you can see in the world, and they'll be yours. 

Cons:
- This is my biggest complaint: Yasuke should be playable way earlier in the story. Getting him at the end of Act 1 just feels odd; while I prefer playing as an assassin, I feel bad for the people that were excited to play as Yasuke only to have to play for 10+ hours if you no life it and do zero side quests to even see him (and rush through the game). I kinda wish they would allow us to pick between who we want to play as in the beginning, as go through the story as either Naoe or Yasuke because I feel like the end of Act 1 shows us that they'd end up in the same place for different reasons anyway. I don't want to post any spoilers, but seeing as we even see a montage of Naoe basically be comatose for a bit after the prologue, that could have been a valid explanation for if we wanted to play as Yasuke and why we don't meet Naoe for quite a bit until the culmination of Act 1.
- We can't preview gear and weapons in the shops which is insane to me. We even have that separate menu for previewing what we have in our inventory, why couldn't that just be applied to the shop?
- While the prologue is good, it kept jumping between flashbacks and time skips which made it hard to keep track of what is the present and what was the past. 
- I was always going to play with Japanese audio/English subs because English is not my native language and I always prefer to have the language spoken match where the game either is from or where it is taking place. That being said, the English VA's for the game are just lacking. I would highly recommend playing in Immersive Mode, which makes the audio match with the time period and setting (aka Japanese people speak  Japanese, Portugese people speak Portugese). 
- A very minor thing, but I would love to have some more mini games, even if it's just for fun and there's no real reward for it. 

That being said, I am only in the beginning stages of Act 2 so I am not finished with the game just yet and I will definitely take my sweet time enjoying playing it. I highly recommend playing it!",True,0,0,1742816904,76561198747685393,6048

191065097,english,"This is a pretty solid game. 

Firstly, it looks absolutely stunning and has worked perfectly out of the box for me even with my outdated drivers since I'm too lazy to update them. There really are so many beautiful vistas in this game that I really did find myself slowing right down to a walk so I could gaze at some beautiful temple nestled in the mountains made even better by the changing seasons. The environmental storytelling from Ubisoft is also excellent, especially in the most wartorn parts of the map. 

The stealth in this game feels excellent, especially on expert difficulty with the assassination setting turned on. Enemies have eyes, they will notice bodies and the player from a fair distance away. It also means that Naoe can't just spend all her time on the high ground. The expert combat difficulty is also good. Enemies will flank and be more aggressive. Yasuke makes a very good amount of sense in these situations. Speaking of Yasuke and Naoe I like how they're both opposites of each other. Naoe feels excellent when it comes to stealth but really struggles in open combat against Samurai or Ronin while Yasuke has basically 0 stealth ability but can demolish a group of Ronin and send Samurai flying across the map. Great fun. 

The story is hit or miss. The immersive Japanese - Portuguese dub is a nice listen and everything is competently voice acted. However, everything in the story happens too quickly. For example, the lead up and climax to act one happens too fast so the player doesn't have enough time to get properly invested. Also, the conflict between Naoe and Yasuke is resolved wayyyy to quickly (within one cutscene). In my mind, the story is at its best when discussing more philosophical aspects. For example, there was a quest in act one requiring Naoe to learn tea ceremony etiquette. That was nice, and then another situation in act two when Naoe and Yasuke are watching a Sumo wrestling match and this dude is telling them who will win.

I'm enjoying the side activities for the most part. Meditating, doing Kata, collecting trinkets at beautiful temples and praying offer a very nice change of pace from combat. Killing the special samurai at the various castles is also very enjoyable because of their unique designs and specific gameplay challenges. 

One other thing that I really appreciate this game for is how you don't kill animals for crafting materials. Instead, you pet the domesticated ones and make beautiful artwork of the wild ones, Bob Ross style and then put the art on display in your hideout which I think is a neat addition. 

In terms of additional negatives The poor facial animations during cutscenes are jarring and the cash shop / battlepass are cringe but thankfully neither are shoved in your face and can be completely ignored.

191063153,english,"the combat system is the worst ever, group assassinations/stun group executions, are deleted, and stop telling us enemy difficulty is relevant when all you're doing is spawning in bullshit unexistant mobs 2 levels above the mobs you're FORCING us to assassinate in the first place, that has nothing to do with enemy difficulty that is You being a total ass. Ubisoft fails everyone again. Even the whole wanted mechanic is as worthless as ubisoft itself cuz all its designed to do is force you to play a character other than the one you want. The combo's and executions are mostly stale, especially if you're playing Naoe, in which case you're probably equally turned off by the actual story chances Ubisoft dropped the ball on, to get Naoe a second hidden blade, and quit forcing us to waste a weapon slot on a tanto, just to be able to double assassinate. As much as Yasuke getting 4 weapons, god health on combat, instant kill combos, and Naoe getting absolutely nothing in comparision, being the only actual assassin, it is crazy weird she doesn't even get the combat supremacy yet makes a big deal out of cowardly weapons. Nor gets extra stealth weapons like the bow and arrow, but does get a chain that rattles like crazy, as if no one would hear that. Many stranger decisions have been made, most of which entirely against Naoe, while Diogo (Refuse to call him Yasuke, didn't even ask consent to take the name.) Gets to walk on easy street Naoe gets one-shotted. You might as well have called it Samurai's creed. Because it focusses more on that than the actual assassin, or forces you into it because the assassin is actually inadequate in combat And apparently doesn't wanna learn to use more weapons or even the long katana, which she could easily learn to use through Diogo. Nor anyone think to even pick up the hidden blade on granpa shinobi, or the many corpses in the kofun Hanzo sends you to. There are a ton of avenues for Naoe especially to be far more adept, at everything, Ezio would be rolling in his grave and Altair might actually haunt her now. Not to mention the wasted skill slot, and the lax decision of not even springing for 3 weapon slots while both of them can easily carry it. And lets just ignore the entire failure thats the objectives board, making it entirely impossible to track your quests, including even remotely being able to find The Tournament Quest, animus mandates you do, but the entire board makes impossible to find, You cant honestly think we're going to remember who gives what quest with 20 cities of people wanting something from you at the same darn time. BTW its on the yamato peoples, not that THEY will make any effort to prioritize it before its mandated to progress! Just like for a game HINGING on it being day or night, you have absolutely NO control over when it is day or night, you cant sit on any furniture making your entire base a lame waste of time with absolutely no furniture options on top of it, and you cant even lay down on any beds including the ones you own, not even to take a nap and pass the time to the time of day you NEED, cuz you cant see half diogo's fricking targets on the horseback minigames just cuz its night, and you lose 12% damage on naoe just cuz its fricking daytime! And while im on diogo, while he carries 2 swords, the iconic dual wield of wakizashi and katana, is not present on either character, even though Diogo actually carries Both. Let alone the audacity of Ubisoft actually putting limitations on when we can and cant save our game, which is btw, a completely batcrap decision, ill decide when i save, and you fkin save it.

191062858,english,"I write this as someone who genuinely hates Ubisoft, this game is probably Ubisoft's best title in a decade. Of course it has a major flaw for me but first of all I want to go over what, or at least some of what, makes it so good in my opinion:

The visuals are absolutely phenomenal, I haven't seen storms look quite as good as they do in this game as they do in any title before. even Ghost of Tsushima. This game captures feudal Japan much better than I expected when I first saw it's trailers.

The world feels lively, which is uncommon, if not, unheard of from any Ubisoft title before. the wildlife, the NPCs, the enemies, it genuinely just all feels good and nice to explore.

The seasons system, I needn't keep this one long, but this game features a seasons system and it makes the world feel that much more dynamic and beautiful.

The story, at least so far, is rather enjoyable. I figured I wouldn't care much for it but about 15 hours in and I'm rather engaged in it.

The base building is a nice addition to the game, its simplistic and detailed enough for me and in a game where that isn't the main focus it's a great touch.

The armour/weapons and customization is amazing, the artists definitely put in a ton of effort into this game and it shows, and the option to change the appearance of your weapon or armour to another is such a good addition to it all.

The parkour is fluid, if not, a bit janky at times. But I honestly can't remember an assassin's creed game without janky parkour in some spots. 

The bounty system is a welcome return as well. I haven't seen that in an assassin's creed game for a while, and this brings me to mention the AI. Honestly, It's a breath of fresh air from the mongoloid AI from other Ubisoft titles, The AI is good at overwhelming you but not to the point it makes combat annoying and constantly frustrating, this isn't dark souls after all. It also brings stealth to a much more in depth level than other creed games.

the collectibles, These I honestly expected to be boring because normally Ubisoft butchers any fun to be had in open world with boring collectibles through tedious puzzles to get an awful weapon you'll never use. They're quick and don't interrupt the gameplay loop to the point you just get frustrated or bored, and if the rewards aren't great, you can deconstruct it, level it up, or just use it to apply the appearance of your current weapon/armour should you think it looks cooler. 

now while there's probably some more pros I haven't mentioned I want to go over my biggest con for this game, which I'm sure you've seen other people complain about too.

The asking price, $90 CAD is a lot of money to pay for a game, regardless of the studio/quality. Especially when it comes to Ubisoft... which brings me to my next point, The microtransactions. The game just released and there's already microtransactions, for a fucking $90 game. I know this isn't the devs fault, it's the slimy suits pushing for it. But it's just atrocious and unacceptable, yet, completely expected from Ubisoft. And I hate it. There's a $45 bundle for cosmetics and currency, on top of being able to buy currency separately for the cosmetics/weapons/armour in the shop. Again... for a fucking $90 game. It's a miracle they haven't started implementing ads every time you need to revive, it would be a very Ubisoft thing to do after all. But I guess at least this game doesn't shove the microtransactions in your face all the time.

So I leave it there, this game is amazing, despite it's public appearance going down the drain before it dropped due to their shenanigans on twitter. This will probably Ubisoft's last good game for a while as well. But wait for it to be on sale, unless you have the money to throw at it.",True,0,1,1742813344,76561198991820169,1128

191060508,english,"As a long-time Assassin's Creed fan, I can confidently say Shadows is the most impressive entry since Black Flag. Ubisoft has truly delivered an experience that feels like a love letter to hardcore fans while pushing the series to the next level.

The graphics are absolutely stunning - easily some of the most beautiful visuals I've seen in any game. Performance-wise, it runs flawlessly smooth, making the world feel even more immersive. The story is solid and engaging, with a well-paced narrative that kept me hooked from start to finish. Combat strikes a great balance between the series’ roots and fresh, innovative mechanics that feel both familiar and exciting.

Having enjoyed Origins and Odyssey, I can honestly say that Shadows elevates the formula in all the right ways. Ubisoft may have just pulled a lifesaver on the franchise with this one, revitalizing what made AC so special while modernizing it for today’s players.

It's worth mentioning that some of the negative reviews focus on the requirement for the Ubisoft launcher, but in my opinion, that has no bearing on the quality of the game itself.

If you're a die-hard fan, Shadows is a must-buy. Even if you’re more of a casual AC player, it’s absolutely worth picking up -at full price or at least on sale. The level of craftsmanship here, especially when it comes to visuals, is simply next level.",True,0,1,1742810006,76561199007032973,5781

191060128,english,"Saw a lot of negativity before release, which sort of scared me away from the game originally. I decided to give it a go on launch and so far it's been pretty hard to put it down. For me it comes into the same AC genre as Valhalla and Odyssey thus far, it's a fun ""period piece"" game, but doesn't seem to have as much of a link to the ""true"" AC games as others might have (or at least that's how it seems this far in).

Performance and graphics-wise, I'm running a 4070 super with 7700x and have been able to comfortably run the game on higher settings without an issue. I have no doubt the optimisation may be poor for lower spec machines, but it's certainly nothing like I expected after the MH: Wilds launch. 

The world's setting of a Feudal Japan doesn't catch my eye nearly as much as Ghost of Tsushima did, and neither does the writing. I don't like to compare the two games, as they're set 300 years apart and clearly have different aims as to character development, but as two Samurai/Shinobi style RPGs it's bound to happen (as it has since its reveal).

All in all, I can happily say it's been worth the £60 price tag so far. The world is large enough for you to have a lot to do, and the way they've integrated Naoe and Yasuke's backstories into smaller segments within the open world is something I'm a big fan of. It's fun as a single player game, but adding a battle pass and keeping the helix store are both things that I can't agree with (typical Ubisoft greed). If someone were to ask ""should I buy AC Shadows or Ghost of Tsushima"" (which is something I've been asked a couple of times before by friends) my recommendation would have to be the latter. The story is more compelling, the combat feels better, and the music fits much better than whatever they decided to put into this 1500s Feudal Japan era game. 

TLDR; Strong 8/10, fun Feudal Japan ""period piece"", but falls short to similar games that have come before it. I'd recommend to buy if that's what you're looking for, but if you're expecting Ghost of Tsushima 2.0 then don't get your hopes up.

191059468,english,"This game is by far my favourite instalment in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I have played every single game in it. The world is stunning, characters are fun and I have enjoyed myself in it so much. As I have now finished it, I am editing this. The game is not without it's faults. But historical inaccuracies are not one that really matters in the grand scheme of things. The world feels alive and the people are responsive. The weather system is beautiful, as is the scenery. I have lost a lot of faith in Ubisoft over the years, they have had some questionable choices with Skull & Bones, Valhalla, Prince Of Persia over the years and also Star Wars Outlaws. This is probably the only newer game of theirs I have genuinely enjoyed since they released Odyssey. 

Now, in regards to the people upset about it that will comment on this, because for some reason they have absolutely nothing better to do with their lives than attack every single person who has played this game and said anything nice about it: 

Assassin's Creed has never been ""Historically accurate"". You kill the pope in Assassin's Creed 2, there's doorknobs in Unity and they weren't even invented until 100 years later. George Washington is an evil tyrant king. The assassin order died out after the events of the first game, as did the knights templar. It's historical fiction, they have told you this since the first ever Assassin's Creed game with their disclaimer ""Inspired by historical events and characters, this work of fiction was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs."" You fight gods, you fight mythical beings. It's NOT historically accurate.

Yasuke seems to be a huge topic of attack, he is not a topic of debate. You're all attacking him being in the game. Do I think the game would have been better if it was just Naoe and Yasuke was a side character? Absolutely. But people are upset about optional romances, for christ sake. If you don't want your character in a same gender relationship? Just don't make those choices, they're clearly marked with a love heart when you are flirting. Being upset about you making those choices and your character being in those relationships is equal to going into the street, begging someone to punch you in the face and then being upset they did that. It's all your choice. 

Also, it really seems to be the majority white people upset about it for the Japanese people. The issues the Japanese have had with it have been addressed, they have been fixed. The main point of contention being ""Destructible items in the shrines"" was that they were concerned that if the players could do that in a game that some might do it in the actual shrines. 

There was no uproar about being able to kill the monks in their churches and then burn them in Valhalla, there was no uproar about being able to execute the pope, there was no uproar about any of the other cultures in any of the other games, you all just care because it's in Japan.

Sure there's some good in them but the amount of bloat with the lack of any intrigue or substance is baffling.

After these 24 hours I think I can say I'll never play this game again and I wish I'd never bought it.
Any reviewer giving this game 4/5, 5/5, 9/10 or 10/10s are not to be trusted.

Story:
Right from the get go the game tries to lay some basis for why Yasuke is there. Only for you to not talk/interact with him ever again for ~6-10 hours.
After that little bit in the beginning with Yasuke you're then thrown into the fray with Naoe. 
I won't go too much into details here for spoilers but to say the story is fragmented and structured horridly is a understatement.
Another mark against the story I'd say would be the English VA and script writing. Maybe some of the weird one liners or conversations are due to poor translations or something but almost every interaction is as jarring as it is awkward. There's some glimpses of good writing in there but it's drowned out but all the absurdity. Only reason it's getting a 4 from me in this subject is due to the few laughs it can give because of how dumb the writing can be. But hey at least it's a story.
If Ubisoft somehow survives maybe the next one will actually have a good story. Both memory and modern day wise. I wouldn't hold my breath though.
4/10

Graphics:
With everything to the highest setting it can look pretty nice. Night's look great when accompanied by the glint of a blade or one of the MANY lanterns, candles and torches. The shades of sunsets are very pretty and are a perfect recreation of what comes to mind when one says ""Golden hour"". Water is fine. Nothing really special about the water itself. Diving underwater isn't very special either. No fish, coral and barely any decorations like wrecks or shrines. I won't say the graphics themselves are bad. Because they aren't. I just think Ghost of Tsushima's overall graphical style was better.
8/10

Gameplay:
I'm personally not a huge fan of modern AC combat. It's fine, just not refined in a way that can make me feel like a badass during the original generation. I personally think AC shouldn't have gone ""Full RPG"" with these games. In Shadows I was hoping for some meaningful game play differences between the 2 characters and there is. Just not in the way you think.
Noae- She probably has the best parkour system we've seen in a AC game since Unity. However, I wouldn't say it's better then Unity. The same AC parkour jank still hasn't changed much so don't get your hopes up. They made the correct choice in deciding to have select movements turn into tiny cut-scene/animations that might interrupt the flow just a bit in terms of speed but it makes up for it in style. I hope if Ubisoft continues making AC games in this same style or otherwise they really build on this parkour system from Naoe. Making every assassin here on out even more expressive. Stealthiness with Naoe is what you would expect. Nothing too fancy that we haven't seen in the past. Combat wise she looks as cool as she seems in trailers. It's too bad she can barely put up a fight. If you get in a fight with more then two people? Good luck. Which is fine. As long as she can assassinate better right? Well when the engravings, parkour and THE ASSASSINATION BUTTON ITSELF works then yes. Multiple times I had to re-assassinate someone because somehow the assassination button is a bit bugged IN A ASSASSINS CREED GAME. Can't think of any other AC game I've played were that's happened besides maybe Unity? Either way, just a sad tidbit.
Yasuke- Broken out of the box. Combat wise at least. Dude can't traverse hardly at all and has no way of stealth. However he 110% makes up for the lack of stealth in raw power. Anytime you have a issue playing Noae I suggest playing Yasuke instead because it turn the otherwise hellish jank of the combat system into oddly shaped swiss cheese. Easy mode to put it simply. If you just want to bum rush through story you're doing it with this guy. He's cool for a tankish hulk of a character but personally not what i care for in comparison to seeing a master assassin like Edward or Ezio take out the same number of people with more varied animations.
Both - The modern combat design, to me, just isn't interesting. I dislike after all these years and iterations we still have a limit of 3-5 animations per type of kill. After maybe 3-4 hours of playing Naoe you've pretty much seen every kill animation outside of skills. Same goes for Yasuke. I like that playing Naoe is how a AC game should be played. The challenge stealth CAN provide is nice. 
Enemy NPCs - Everything about them is annoying for various reasons depending on who you play and in what situations you're in. Every time I'd died very rarely did I feel like I died due to a lack of ""skill"". When I die in something like a Souls game or Ghost of Tsushima I can't too often say the same thing. In those games 9/10 it comes down to skill. Because those games have good combat and encounter design. 
Bosses/Elites - Just regular mobs with slightly more health/armor with MAYBE 1 slightly different move-set. Otherwise every enemy type is the same. Even the Bosses.
6/10

Exploration: Scaling in this game is also very questionable. How scaling is working alongside gearing and stats just makes no sense in a AC game to me. In a game about uncovering mysteries, exploring the work with parkour(which is a form of self expression) and combat you'd think they'd design a system where levels don't matter. With levels and the harsh scaling present here is actively works against your natural curiosity to explore the world at your own pace in your own way. Instead you'r forced into these zones were you have to interact with the same bases/castles, bandits and outposts. After 20hrs I've more then seen it all at this point. Same tree and castle get reused for almost every sync point. Some sync points are so out of the way you'd swear they're there to just waste time. Puzzles or Parkour challenges? Nonexistent. The new ""Scout"" system is also a time waster as well. 
Additionally, after a while you just start to see the Ubisoft copy/paste mentality everywhere. A world that, at first, seems pretty and unique is actually just a facade. If you've seen one building/castle/fort/camp/enemy/bridge/town you've seen them all. Very rarely does anything stand out. Even when something DOES stand out it's cheapened by the surrounding copy/paste job.
I knew that due to the general Ubisoft design I was going to be looking at icons more then the world itself but I didn't know this game would also start making look at my map almost as much as the other menus. Honestly I think my playtime has been split equally in menus as it has been exploring and working through story. It's just a repetitive, dated blueprint designed to suck as much time from you as possible. Nothing about this games exploration is particularly fun to me.
3/10

Overall:
6/10 Meh.
I hope one day we'll start to get more detail and passion into our AC games and less bloat, battle passes and cash shop items. Maybe then will AC resurface into a new golden era. I really do hope for the best with the AC franchise. The potential with it's story and it's themes from movement to combat can be a inspiration, truly engaging and fun. Just have to keep waiting to see if it'll ever happen. Because AC: Shadows, for me, just isn't it. If you too are disappointed in this game and haven't played Ghost of Tsushima yet I highly recommend it. Plus you can play that with friends with a totally separate story than the main game. Unlike any assassins creed game since Unity.

Honestly I could go on about every tiny thing in this game but at this point I think I've shared my biggest issues with the game that might help make other people make a decision on whether to buy or not buy the game.
Best of luck everyone.

191057895,english,"absolutely baffled this is the same company that made star wars fartlaws
I think if this game didn't have as much awful micro transactions and unnecessary level grinding I bet most people would give this game a 6 or 7/10, but there's just so much bloat to this game at first it's overwhelming. 

I'm really not a fan of the newer acslop games to be completely honest, to me they seem like games designed for 50 year old retired cash cows that like to waste money on xp in a singleplayer game, and it's grindy to the point only a mmo fan could appreciate.

But that all being said, the stealth is actually pretty fun, the combat is snappy and responsive, and there's at least some challenge on the highest difficulty. I would love to give this game a solid 7 or 8 out of ten, but the story is extremely corny, and the english VA is laughably bad, and after all that I still have to grind to the right level in order to assassinate certain characters.

191057537,english,"The game is a lot better than I thought it would be for sure, pretty fun.  Its another long one for sure(Ubisoft open world). The main gripe I have is that the games combat is easy, until its glitchy af, then its just plain annoying. Swapping weapons seems to cause an animation lock that stops you from being able to parry until 3 or 4 seconds AFTER the weapon swap is complete(mid combat weapon swaps are annoying). There is also an odd issue when you go to throw a kunai and it just blatantly will not let you throw a kunai until you release RMB then press it again to zoom back in, THEN it will allow you to throw the kunai.
   Writing seems pretty good, about the same as Valhalla. It does feel like they toned the collectibles down a bit, and consolidated them into individual location challenges(so you find 3 scrolls at a specific temple and are rewarded, rather than the past few games where you have to hunt down 500 of each of the 20 different types of collectibles). 
   The hideout builder is definitely a step up from the base ""builder"" that Valhalla had. Shadows allows you to actually design the layout and placement of all your buildings as opposed to the Valhalla aspect, that just has sign posts for you to ""build"". Obtaining crafting materials is so much less tedious in Shadows, Valhalla felt annoying and tedious, where as in Shadows you can pretty much just collect the loot from the places you visit and still be able to build your buildings. Plus the materials respawn(I think, lol). 
   Speaking of the loot... The obtaining of legendary loot seems a bit too easy IMO. I have only barely finished the first section/area(meaning completed the castles and found all the sync points and meditation stuff/temples) and I have full legendary gear... It kinda makes finding common stuff kinda pointless. 
   The objectives screen IMO is also annoyingly chaotic and caters hard to consoles/controllers. Growing up, for me, the web type of outline was literally the most annoyingly childish and useless of all outlines(in terms of making an outline for an essay) back when I was in school so maybe I am biased, but that was unfortunately something they carried over from the past few games, and even expanded upon it. Valhalla at least still had a quest list that you could open, that was aside from your main bad guy assassination targets, to get a plain LIST of quests. This game does not have that. Its just the annoying web and a chain of quests is simply tied directly to each target (I like that they are linked to specific targets, just not the way they used a web outline lmao).
   Everything aside, I definitely think the game has areas of improvement in terms of the combat, as well as some of the item distribution, and for future games I have hope for my own personal preferences(like the dang web being removed lmfao) but the game plays, it is not as hard on my PC as Valhalla was, the theme is cool af, the story is decently entertaining, characters are not really annoying(so far) , and I am having fun. The game also does a good job of building upon the last games for the most part.
   In the end, I would recommend this game ONLY at a 60$ price tag. Ubisoft needs to downsize and find its roots, and while I think shadows is a decent direction towards finding said roots, Ubisoft is bloated and the consumers are bearing that burden by paying for that through the 70$ price tag. Ubisoft should still be ashamed to be in the same class as Activision in terms of their price tags and marketing, I just hope they don't start chopping the base games up to sell in pieces like Activision does. I still recommend the game, but in a disgruntled way. Ubisoft needs to understand that gamers don't buy the BS when it comes to ""how much it costs to make a game"". You don't need a 70$ price tag AND a battle-pass AND live service-like EXPENSIVE cosmetics in a singleplayer game and any of your employees telling you otherwise are full of it.

P.S. Also, to Ubi (doubt you are reading), if you sell to a company based in China or rather any company that has agreed to China's 51% ownership requirement OR its military-civil fusion requirements, I will never purchase a Ubisoft game again. :D",True,0,0,1742805211,76561198036846953,1412

191057244,english,"My Assassin's Creed Shadows Review:

So far, the game’s been a pretty solid experience, but with a few highs and some major lows.

The Good:

Cinematics: The cutscenes are hands down the best I’ve seen in the Assassin's Creed series. Definitely a highlight! 

Map Size: The world is HUGE! Tons of opportunities to explore at your own pace. 

Music: Hot take—I’m actually vibing with the music choice. It fits the game really well. 

Combat: Another controversial opinion—I actually don’t mind the leveling system. I don’t want to steamroll through the game, so I don’t mind grinding for upgrades. ⚔️

Story: It’s a pretty typical revenge plot, but it’s still enjoyable enough. 

Voice Acting: The English voice acting is decent, though it could be better. 

The Bad:

Microtransactions: The timing of the microtransactions, especially so soon after launch, makes no sense. Plus, there's a battle pass in a SINGLE PLAYER game?  It’s kind of ridiculous that you can buy gear for real money, only to realize it’s also available in the exchange for in-game currency. Worst part? Some of these sets cost a ridiculous amount of money, like $20 for a single armor set. 
Pay-to-Win Gear: Some of the microtransactions make the paid gear way too powerful. Bought a gun for real money and it’s dealing 200% more damage than anything else in the game. Not exactly fair... 💸

Final Thoughts: Despite the annoying microtransactions, the game’s a lot of fun! But seriously—avoid the $35 premium bundle like I did.

There’s always something fun to do, and while there are a few quality-of-life improvements that could be made, the developers are actively listening to the community, so future patches should smooth things out.

One request for Ubisoft: please add mythical creatures in upcoming expansions or DLC! It would add so much variety to enemy encounters and make the world even more immersive.

As for performance, the game is CPU-optimized rather than GPU-optimized. If you can get it running well, it maintains stable frames, but there’s definitely room for optimization from both the game developers and GPU manufacturers.

Plot [7/10]

The story is based during the ""Tenshō Iga War"" of 1579. A civil war within the shogun era. Yasuke & Noae are *supposedly* real characters in history. As the player, we get to see both sides of the war, from before it started to after it ends. Though, you choose a story to play at the start, both characters will become playable eventually. Personally, i'm not a fan of building up a main character to then have to switch in between 2 characters halfway through the game, BUT it actually works out well. Naoe is stealth, and relates more to the movement of past ac games, while Yasuke resembles more of a warrior/shogun, balls to the wall, fighting everyone style. So switching between the two serves it's purpose throughout the story.

Overall, a good story. But it does share the same structure as other ac games. You're an assassin and you kill a series of targets, hunting them down 1 by 1, in order to reach the main target. As all ac games play out. It's fun. This game does a good job with breaking up that repetitive feeling by seasoning a TINT of backstory side quests that are more *emotional* and cinematic. 


Combat [8/10]

Overall, both the stealth and in your face combat is fun. Being able to consistently switch between the two keeps it interesting. I'm always a fan of ac combat though~


Movement [3/10]

Oddly enough, for a game known for it's movement for decades, this was the worst part of the game. It may have just been my experience but HOLY. My god. LET ME SPEAK ABOUT THE HILLS. JAPAN HAS A LOT OF THEM. WAY TO MANY... so why can't I climb up them? Why is it so hard to climb up a mountain in this game. Not even to climb, TO WALK up a mountain. We get any slant and you fall and slide down . Sometimes you say ""OKAY I cant get up that 2ft lump, maybe i'll just climb up these rocks that look perfectly capable of being climbed to get to this EAGLE SPOT THAT YOU HAVE TO STOP AT EVERY COUPLE OF MILES."" and they're always at the top of a mountain. The hardest mountain to get on. Why did they do that... 

Also, you clip, you stop, at any edge of everything. There's a collision detection for every edge so that you can manually do your front flip off but don't jump before you hit the edge or you hit an invisible wall. It's janky. It sucks. But... at times it was actually pretty cool and fun to flip around WHen it works. But it usually doesn't. 

Visuals [7/10]

Maybe the best ac visuals yet. Though, not Ghost of Tsushima... . Still very pleasant though


Characters [7/10]

Yasuke and Naoe are very likable characters; Yasuke especially. Aside from that, nobody sticks out too much. I kinda wish there were more unique traits with each person you meet.


Grind [9/10]

Close to no grind is necessary in this game. You can basically follow the main quest line and keep even with each area. It's definitely worth grinding knowledge points though. That is achieved through mini side activities which never really felt annoying or tedious to do.


Difficulty [4/10]

Game isn't too bad but you will get killed within 1-2 hits from all enemies. You can choose difficulty options though. I played on the hardest.

Immersion [8/10]
There's an ""immersion"" option you can turn on and off. This game is really good if you want to sort of be a detective. 90% of the missions will give you clues to where you will find someone and you need to do some deductions and brain thinks to find the targets.

Only reason why I took off the 2 points is because of the movement. How many times I just wanted to be immersed and I couldn't jump of a 2ft rock I was standing because COLLISION .

191052872,english,"In my opinion anyone giving this game a fair review would have to give Shadows a 7-8/10. Personally, I land on he high end giving it a solid 8/10 (so far). Not a generational RPG but a well above average entry to the action RPG the genre. I'm ignoring all of the irrelevant controversy and just grading the game. 

For reference, I score 
- BG3 10/10, - Elden Ring 10/10, 
- Witcher 3 9.5/10, - Cyber Punk (post Phantom Lib) 9.5/10
- FF7 Rebirth 9/10, - Metaphor Re. 9/10, Monster Hunter Worlds 9/10
- RE Village 8.5/10, - Persona 5 8.5/10 
- AC Valhalla 7.5/10, AC Origins 7/10
- Dragon Age Veilgaurd 5-6/10, - Forspoken 5-6/10

Pros
- Great Graphics! This game is an absolutely Beautiful and well optimized game. RTX 4080/32 GB DDR4RAM/12700K CPU. Averaging a smooth 80-90 FPS, 3840/2160 with DLSS native AA & Fram-gen on/all setting maxed out.
- Good character customization with plenty of different skins (without using the store).
- Fun combat. Not pivotal or groundbreaking but definitely satisfying. Lots of skills/builds, great stealth mechanics, good animations.
- Naoe really feels like a ninja!
- Enjoyable gameplay loop. I liked Odessey/Origins/Valhalla RPG AC games and this one refines the formula.
- So far the Story is engaging. Nothing special, but it is engaging enough.
- Customizable Base of operations
- Healthy amount of graphics/gameplay options

Cons
- 30 FPS cut scenes...(Download Special K for a fix)
- Repetitive side quest (if you choose to do them all)
- Immersion Breaking music
- Clunky dual protagonist system (both characters are fun in heir own right but switching can be jarring).

If you hate the new RPG AC games with huge open worlds and tons of busy quests (most of which is skipable), then the gameplay loop wont impress. If you liked Origins or Valhalla you'll love this as an improved version in an amazing setting with good gameplay mechanics and great graphics. Not perfect but pretty good.

Some personal notes:
Shadow's has been unduly effected by review bombing, culture war attacks, and the fight between independent/ big game media. Don't let negativity-bandwagon riding social media reviewers tell you this game isn't good.
 
My assessment is based on the game for what it is, a game, despite the over inflated controversy. 
Yes, Ubisoft made some poor decisions and underestimated how protective some Nihonjin are of their culture. But, they acknowledged those mistakes and tried to course correct. The cultural issues with the release of this game boil down to a lack of understanding about the difference between high context cultures (most Eastern societies) and low context cultures (most Western societies). However none of the cultural lines crossed were malicious in intent and are a non-factor in gameplay.

Yes, the costar is based on a historic figure who's past is debatable. It would have made more sense to make a Japanes male Samurai as a costar. But, Yasuke existed and artistic freedom is ok. The artificial outrage is mind numbing. I'm not offended by a black man portrayed as a Samurai and I doubt the click bate culture war reviewers have honest intentions. I've enjoyed a lot of the different forms Afro-Samurai media over the years and Yusake is fun to play as. I don't remember anyone having so much outrage over any other form of media that depicted the Yasuke based Afro-Samurai, why now? 

Yes, Ubisoft as a company has made some bad decisions and fell on hard times. But, hoping for or finding enjoyment in watching a company that employs so many fail is just a bad look IMO

Yes, their use of over priced deluxe game versions and micro-transactions can be distasteful. But the store isn't forced down your throat here and everyone is welcome to by the base game skipping the bloated options. If you want to make in game purchases or buy a deluxe edition, then the option exists for you and more power to you.",True,0,0,1742797114,76561199375613969,2561

191052265,english,"I really enjoyed my time in AC: Shadows. I'm a series veteran that have finished every major AC game release since the original AC. Although the series has transformed from a truly stealth-oriented game into a more action RPG style, AC: Shadows represents the best of the modern AC games.

Excellent performance on my PC across the board, stable FPS, very well optimized with high graphics settings. Some bugs are expected, but the only major one I've encountered was with frame generation. Graphics are beautiful and detailed, with some of the most enchanting visuals of Japan I've ever seen in a video game. The atmosphere is quite immersive, with great Japanese voice acting and music (although sometimes modern rock/hip-hop style music breaks the immersion, but these only happen in a few story missions).

Gameplay is great, whether you like to play full stealth (with Naoe) or hack-and-slash (with Yasuke). With Naoe, you have a selection of standard stealth gadgets like smoke bombs and throwing knives, and the abilities of the classic assassins such as parkour and hidden blade. Yasuke can use heavier weapons such as the naginata and mace, and both characters feels very different with unique weapons and skill sets. The stealth system is solid, with the dynamic shadow system making your approach to every situation unique. Combat is fluid and based on fast-paced parries, dodges, and special abilities. 

The map is huge, and even with 30 hours, I maybe have only explored about a third of the map. Most of the map are mountains and forests, with many outposts, temples, shrines, and other activities dotted all around. Unlike previous games, the assassination board is much larger, with targets from multiple factions all over Japan, each with their own story and rewards.

As with other reviews, my main gripe with AC: Shadows is the microtransaction system, although this is unsurprising for a modern AC game. Treasure and activity maps are locked behind a paywall. Facial animations also feels off, although maybe more apparent in immersive mode (Japanese/Portuguese)? I haven't tried in English. Fast travel points are also quite annoying, as they are mostly far apart, and many of these are located on top of castles, which are always guarded and restricted. Synchronizing from a fast travel point does not open up the map around it, but instead only shows undiscovered locations around it (you still have to actually go near each location to open up the map and see what the location actually is).

And I looked into this yasuke guy, hes from japanese culture hes in their media going back to the 1960s even. not a woke insert...even if thats the intention of the game. I think it outlines Oda Nobunagas meritocratic ways, even if its prob not how things happened. There are letters between future Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa retainers and Oda Clan, discussing Nobunaga's black retainer. Clearly showing he had holdings and had risen up in Nobunagas meritocratic clan. Remember the future shogun, former ally of ieyasu was also a poor sandal bearer under Oda Nobunaga who became HIS GENERAL, after Nobunaga's death Hideyoshi became shogun and remained shogun until a failed invasion of korea. Hideyoshi was a poor samurais son, and would of been treated like dirt in other clans, because the word samurai just meant servant warrior essentially not ""lord knight"" like these people are pretending.

 Sengoku japan, and owari provinces' Oda didnt have the strict caste system implemented by other clans and the Future shogun Ieyasu tokugawa, samurai were not like a caste yet. During sengoku a poor Oda Ashigura spearman would be a samurai for Nobunaga.

 This mythical idea people have about the warrior class comes from the Edo Period shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa only allowing samurai to be armed, and making it a title for his nobility. Sort of a merchant/warrior/noble caste like knighthood.

Obviously it's annoying that they made this about a black guy and a woman, but both have relatively historical places in feudal japan.

191050373,english,"We need to talk about this game and the conversation surrounding it.  

Everything I have read for the most part are players, griping, complaining, crying, and judging this title based off of their own subjective comparison to prior AC titles.  Now this is the first Assassins Creed Title I have played since the original on Xbox 360, I believe it was. 

Maybe the fact that my judgement has not been tainted by the successes and failures of Ubisoft plays into the rating I give to Shadows.  

Which is 5 out of 5 stars, Phenomenal.  

This game is immersive.
  
The narrative is great. I found myself getting emotionally involved in both the protagonists' stories off the jump. 

The graphics are Top tier (depending on you're hardware of course, but even on a lower setting they are still good, but let me tell ya, on Ultra, with all the goodies enabled, Flipping awesome! Lots of games have photo modes, but I have been having a lot of fun with AC:Shadows) 

The world is FULL.  Full of life, Scenery, vegetation, animals enemies, places of interest, areas to explore.
The feudal Japan setting is Fantastic.  

Combat is gnarly.  The movement is great, the flow is there, as well as the moves.  It is a smooth, adrenaline pumping experience, and its great that Ubisoft gives the option for more/less gore. 

The gore, though violent, keeps its class. War is war, war is real, violence is real, and Ubisoft does a good job keeping balance in that area.  Based on their history with Tom Clancy titles, and others, I would hope so. 

To mention the stealth, the variety of ways you can go about things or getting your ""mission"" accomplished is wide and inexhaustible, and I'm maybe 4 hours in, but I already see the potential here that I am positive I will encounter as I delve deeper into the title.  

I think my main point here though would be this:

I almost did not buy this title because of what people were saying about it,  but if a player of any genre, can sit down, turn Assassins Creed: Shadows on and not enjoy it while appreciating it for what it is, which is a great, well-done, 3rd person, action/stealth style title...like what are doing? Why do you game? What are your expectations?  Are....you.....not.....Entertained?

If you've never played an AC title, or are having doubts about this one, buy it.  If you are a die-hard AC fan, you probably already did, so to you, I say, Enjoy it, stop being a critic, let others find out for themselves (obviously, I am sure if you are one of the people I am referring too, your opinion is valued in the realm of gaming experience, we need you, but choose your battles, let others give it a chance first.  Its a series you love, give others the chance to love the series as well) 

Focus on whats great about it, and don't expect Ubi to reinvent the wheel.  One day it will be as gaming experience  continues to advance, but until then, appreciate where we are at, and how far we have come.  

If you don't know how far we have come, download an emulator, and play, ""Mission: Impossible"", for the Nintendo 64. That ought to put it into perspective. 

The skill tree has plenty of great options to expand your characters repertoire, as well as your play style.  And though I am not too far in, it appears to me that if you play at the pace the game was intended and let your experience be fluid, your mastery skills come at just the right time.  Not to fast, not to slow. Just in time that when you getting to get bored of one move or combo, BAM! Mastery Point, leveling up, something new. 

The thing I appreciate the most about the title though is when your ADHD kicks in and you find yourself off quest, and on to the un-trodden path , lets say you come up to an activity, side quest, past memory, whatever, the narrative STILL FLOWS WELL.  

Its kinda like that friend, you don't talk to for a long time, and then when you meet up with them, you pick up right where you left off, never skipping a beat.   That is a good comparison to the side quest/main quest relationship in this game.

For starters, I did have some slight issues with crashing in cutscenes, along with some hitching when looting chests, but that may be more of a Linux problem than a performance problem.

Anyway this game is a fun romp through Feudal Japan at the tail end of the Sengoku period. While the game is a stunner in the graphics, it just leaves me wanting more (or sometimes less). The story can be really engaging when it wants to be engaging, but then a character will do something that just doesn't make sense. The gameplay is fun when you are trying to be stealth and picking off guards one-by-one, but loud combat is just a worse version of what From Software does with dodges and parries. The base building is a nice addition, albeit a bit too grindy. Finally the progression system just feels kinda bloated. I don't mind the perk system, but gating off certain perks until you do [x] amount of exploration activities just feels like filler to pad the runtime.

This is the best entry since the Ezio/Desmond days—no joke. Stealth is finally treated like a core mechanic again (you can even go prone! great addition), parkour feels smooth and responsive, and the soundtrack alone is worth experiencing with headphones.

Only 15 hours in and I just unlocked Yasuke, and holy hell… the man is a wrecking ball. Can’t climb for sh*t, but he doesn’t need to. Meanwhile, Naoe is basically the female Solid Snake—stealthy, agile, and lethal in shadows. The contrast between the two is genius.

191048821,english,"The second most disappointing Assassins Creed ever! Mirage is the 1st.

*Minor Issue-Eight years and four open world games and the open world format has not changed or has been innovated. The only change is the setting in which you explore. I loved Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla so I guess the exact same open world design between all four games finally caught up with me.

*Major Issues-
1. The winter seasons last longer than the others and for me it was the worst season to play the game in.
2. You can not switch characters in restricted zones. I have wanted to do so more times than i can count for grabbing collectibles or reaching viewpoints.
3. Not being able to use weapons that i find on each character. Shinobi in real life used Bows so why can't Nome. I want to use all 8 weapon types on whichever character I want.

These may seem like small problems to you but they broke my desire to keep playing. I recommend the game only if you can get past these issues.",False,0,0,1742790581,76561199691386232,2260

191048661,english,"the most fun ive had with a AC game since AC IV Black Flag. for my play style i just set the combat difficulty to low and stealth difficulty to high and turn on garenteed Assassinations to eliminate the lvl requirements for successful assassinations. the game ends up feeling more like the old AC games instead of the new ones that introduced all the RPG mechanics. i still wish they would revert the combat system back to how it was in AC 3 and IV though as that combat system made you feel like a bad ass assassin who could kill anyone in a fight instead of this modern RPG crap where you have to wail on a dude 50 times before he goes down because the number on your stick aint high enough... bunch of BS. the game runs very well even on my setup and my computer isnt the fastest by any means. i get anywhere between 60fps and 90 fps at 1440p on maxed out settings with max raytracing and frame gen turned on and DLSS set to balanced. im using a RTX 4070 Ti Super paired with 32gb of ram @ 3000MHZ and a Ryzen 3700x 8 Cores 16 Threads @ 4.3 GHz. no crashes to desktop in my 13 hours in the game so far. i recommend it to any AC fan. i payed full price but i would recommend getting it on sale if you can wait.if you played AC Origins, Oddessy or Valhalla you wont find much things different here, its still a massive open map with many quests and mostly the same mechanics, the only thing different is the run speed of the female protagonist and the Parkour moves are more acrobatic and dynamic which is a good thing as you can sprint and do a roll dive whenever you want and the female character will do cool flips off of ledges so it end up feeling more like AC unity's Parkour at times. the Samurai character is basically a tank by comparison. all in all its a fun time but it still makes me want to go back and play AC 3 again because nothing is cooler than assassinating British Redcoats as a Bad ass Native American Assassin during the Revolutionary War. 4/5 stars.",True,0,0,1742790348,76561198011095241,1196

191047918,english,"Masterpiece. Gotta say Ubisoft was scaring me a little with the more recent entries to AC before Shadows. Odyssey was not bad but Origins and Valhalla, utter trash. I know there is some backlash over the setting and their choice of Yasuke as a character in an era where there are probably 100s of Japanese Samurai or Shinobis to create a story with. Nevertheless, Yasuke is a superb character, his ability to own on the battlefield makes it so you can choose to mow through waves of enemies,  much easier than with Naoe while still needing a modicum of parry timing, dodges and etc. The absolute gigachad of a war-machine always makes me feel like a one man army when i stroll into a castle through the main gate. Although after only 30 hours, i find myself being able basically do the same thing with Naoe after much practice with timings and the kusarigama + tanto combo w/ the Shadow Barrage ability & Shadow Piercer ability, mowing enemies down with Naoe is nice, but it fights generally go quicker with Yasuke and feel better due to his brutal combat style. Stealth is very one-sided, however, Yasuke is literally not good for anything that is not combat, which is why i only switch to him if the story demands it or if i don't have the patience to sneak through an entire area after dying more than once with Naoe.


Secondly, Not sure why there are skins for sale for real life dollars, i already paid 101 Canadaian Dollars for this 89.99$ + tax, the fact that the items in the shop have passives that are game changing is a little bullshit eh? Also there is a battle pass???? WTF, Ubisoft must really be going in the hole for them to try every single avenue to make money. Single player games should not have micro-transactions i feel like that should be obvious.

Its definitely an Assassin's Creed game, for better or worse. If you're a veteran of this franchise you'll know what that means, some of the best worlds in video games, serviceable gameplay and a story that ranged to just okay to bad. So far the game's mechanics is just fine. Ubisoft remembered they made Splinter Cell and made light and shadow a proper part of the stealth, but it still feels like a half-measure, even with crawling. There's also again, a big lack of social stealth. Combat is again, just fine, better than it was for years, Parkour is again, just serviceable, I wish I could do side and back ejects but Mirage got that in a TU so maybe we'll get it for Shadows too.

So far Shadow's biggest sin is Ubisoft's obsession with non-linear narrative. Because you can chase your targets in any order there isn't any natural development for Naoe's character, no lasting relationships with NPC's, no proper story arcs, as a result there's only the general idea of a story, only random moments with people you randomly find in the game world.

191047288,english,"It is decent. Not all the way there yet, and this review might change after the 35 hour mark, but so far its really interesting with its game-play decisions/overall world. At least for a Ubisoft game that is. Few things really suck here and there like the sheer size of the map (again), and the redundancy of some of these forts. But the main portion of the game is pretty cool. One thing that bothers me more than it should is the horse riding. It is identical to the last 3 entries in a row. Also, Yasuke's ranged weapons are pretty lacklustre, plus Naoe's little tanto weapon, a bit too repetitive for me sometimes. Lastly, it can feel like a  chore to clear things out and do everything on the map, so I'll consistently stay away from trying to complete the whole game. Specifically the castles, which require you to assassinate the Samurai daisho to access the good loot from this area. Sometimes, you are forced to have to kill 5 different Samurai enemies, who are almost always surrounded by 9 to 12 other enemies, and they are such a pain to fight in any capacity, much less stealth. If there was one or two I would get it, but 5 makes this castle clearing mission more about massacring the entire legion of enemies to get a nice headpiece. The facial animations are pretty atrocious, but the game-play cutscenes are honestly such a visual spectacle. They even made the basic dialogue ""cutscenes"" a lot more interesting. I truly wish more games adopted the Horizon Forbidden West style of mo-cap for the dialogue, because that game makes every interaction feel so much more meaningful. Overall, above average, good in a lot of ways and I look forward to playing more. Stealth is the best it's ever been in the series, period. The combat also feels really punchy, except for a few repetitive kill animations that can bog it down. Plus, Yasuke feels pretty cool too. I had no issues with him in the game as a main character (because of the Netflix Anime), and I appreciate the true dichotomy of his play-style versus Naoe's. However, I do understand the loathing that other people have for him as the second playable protagonist. To me though, he just feels so badass and out of place that it feels right for the overall structure. Such a beast, even if it isn't ""historically accurate"".

191047265,english,"Having played this game, we can confirmed that 1) USERS meta-critics score 2)hatreds towards this game, both are unjustified and baseless for those that did not play. Its ok to hate the developers , but we know that its because of that, they are biased towards the gameplay itself. Just by watching the gameplay, do no justice to the game itself VS playing it yourself, find out why in this no spoiler small reviews;

Story: 
Having 20hrs in this game, we can also confirmed that the controversy of ""black samurai impact the inaccurate Japan history"" is 100% argument invalid. Reason for placing a black samurai as Main Character, this allow a good flow and interesting story set up where there is alot of backstory as to why he is in Japan. Imagine putting a usual popular samurai , and end up everyone already predicted what will happened to him, what he did , there is no much interesting story to write about. There will be no interesting link to Naoe who is native Japanese. Yes, in the mid story hours, there is a part where you confirmed will be WOW when the 2 characters meet and their interesting link to each other. There is totally no ""black"" racist story element in this game. It will also be explain why he is in Japan and the people around how they react. 
Story is full of twist and turns where there are parts where u do not expect this to happen. There is also alot of emotional roller coaster ride that dig deep into the background of all characters including NPC. 

Graphics:
The facial animations in cut scenes is very well done where u can see all the emotional details of facial muscle twitching.
Japan scenery is also top notch where each trees leaves moving, wind hitting the bamboo, grass , lighting etc all is very alive. 

Combat and stealth:
They say that you can just blast thru the enemies by button smashing everything. 100000% wrong. The enemies in this game is by far the best modern AC game that have good AI in combat and path-finding (for stealth). Enemy will deflect u, will suddenly open a unblockable attack, will dodge roll away AND will call in all their allies and u will see 10 enemies surround u. So going loud and bang is sometimes not the most optimal way. 
Stealth is super well done. Very good layout of all the infrastructure for u to stealth your way. U will encounter all different layout in each fortress. For expert difficulty, enemies will look up constantly on roof no matter the height of it. Even if u climb around it, they go near the roof to try to find the line of sight of u, if u are spotted, be prepared to be attack by all range weapon. Luckily u can now go prone (laying on your belly) on top of roof, yes crouch down is also not safe. 

Gear and skill progression:
No more tons of gear where all is redundant. Each Epic and above gear u find is essential in different play-style. No more sets gear which makes each gear pieces u find is immediately useful in its perks. No more heavy complex skill tree. Every notch of skill u invest in, u can see the impact during gameplay, its no more surface level passive. 

Open world exploration and quest:
Having 20 hrs in, the world is so alive and full of liveliness where there are thing to see which makes u stop by to see what is that while questing. No more massive icons all around. Places of interest are mark as question mark till u reach near the area by foot where it will be reveal, yes no more eagle summon, no more synchronization on ""tower"" to reveal everything (it will be question mark on the place of interest). Quest marker is now place in such that it circled a large area which encourage to go out and explore to find the target by using the clues. There is also times where quest totally have no marker which makes u needed to go to quest board to find clues. This is by far the least hand-holding AC modern game. Rather than the usual list of quest menu from top to bottom, the quest board is very interesting where investigating the clues given (also what the NPC said) is important.",True,0,0,1742788301,76561197993433857,2457

If you go into Assassin's Creed Shadows with the mindset that it's more of an RPG than a traditional AC title, you'll probably have a better experience. We’re likely never going to see another true good Brotherhood game, and it feels like that—along with Ubisoft's polarizing reputation—sets automatic hate towards these new titles. I get the frustration, I miss the old days, but I think it's important to judge each game on its own merits. Personally, I wasn’t a fan of Origins, Odyssey was good, and I never finished Valhalla, so my expectations for this title were mixed.

Here’s what I liked:

Combat: The combat system is definitely more refined compared to recent titles, offering smoother and more satisfying encounters.

Parkour: Similarly, the parkour mechanics feel tighter and more responsive, making navigation feel more fluid.

Story: While it’s not groundbreaking, the story is engaging enough to keep you invested.

Character Playstyle: The game introduces two distinct characters, each with their own skills and playstyle. One is a brute who excels in strength but isn’t great at parkour, while the other is more in line with traditional assassin abilities. The game also allows you to pick a favorite and focus on that character for most of your playthrough. Y
you are not forced to swap between characters all the time.

Character Depth: Both protagonists have unique backstories, quests, and interactions within the world.

Environment: The game world is absolutely stunning. The environments are beautifully designed, from the architecture to the natural landscapes, making exploration awesome.

My only real criticism is that some of the cutscenes feel a little stiff. At times, the animations can feel robotic, if that makes sense. They kind of dropped the ball with this. For a new game, they should feel more alive. It seems as if only the big story line cutscenes are well done. 
 
In the grand scheme, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an improvement and a step in the right direction. It's definitely worth playing, especially if you can embrace it for what it is rather than what it's not.",True,0,3,1742785382,76561198443581389,4681

The Japanese voice acting is superb. The visual fidelity and environment is gorgeous and detailed.

191044245,english,"24 hours in, I must say this is one of the best Assassin's Creed game there is. I haven't even touched and continued with the main quest. I just finished the prologue then proceeded to explore the world. I eliminated  targets unknowingly through my explorations. Killed ronins, bandits, samurais as I roamed Feudal Japan. Exploring undiscovered locations and getting viewpoints. Died everytime I messed with the wrong samurai.

Much like any other AC games, Ubisoft did a great job for this game, as a ""game"". This is what happens when developers take time and actually develop a game with time and passion, regardless if they lack in some aspects of Japan's culture and tradition. But by reading and seeing the Codex in-game where they put information about Japan's historical shrines and castles, with every detailed information there is about it, I can say they really took time to research Japan. Just the sheer amount of details and design poured out into armors, robes and variety of samurai and ninja weapons speaks for itself. Now outside of this game, regarding any external factors that affects the game, or any internal issues that Ubisoft has, I hope it can be fixed and the developers would take time in restoration of what was once the ""Ubisoft"" that released some of the classic and epic games I have ever played from childhood up until now. 

As a game though, AC Shadows is much like any of its predecessors, it has a huge map than AC Origins, it has a fun and rewarding exploration just like AC Odyssey and more targets and Iside quests than AC Valhalla. I finished every side quests and activities the past games has to offer because I have OCD.  In short, its a compilation of upgrades from past titles. An Assassin's Creed game much like any other.

I honestly think the hate for this game is forced. Rather, the hate for Ubisoft is directed in this game. Which in my opinion is different. Everything I say is opinionated but if people hates Ubisoft then its understandable.  But hating this game because of Ubisoft is not. I'm loving this game but maybe because I'm only using Naoe. It's crazy why this game is receiving unnecessary hate. This game is really great and definitely a contender for top 3 best AC games. 

For fun adventure and open-world exploration: it's alongside Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla
Story-wise and for over-all elements of a RPG Assassin's Creed: it's alongside Syndicate and Blackflag

Shit had me baffled at how stupid contradicting and cringe the story was and if you were here for some actual assassins creed lore about ya know the Japanese brotherhood. Be prepared for 3 or so shitty quests that don't tell u much and end on a cliffhanger. Actual game-play wise its actually pretty good besides a-lot of movement/parkour bugs which besides making faster and flashier. They did not really focus on it because you don't really utilize it that much the map is a lot of forests and the gaps in between roofs usually were to big to make the jump and there were not enough climbable trees. Besides fortress parkour which had a lot more ways to parkour and combine it with stealth that was nice but besides that parkour wasn't really all that useful. Now speaking of stealth it is some of the best in the franchise. Besides the fact it doesn't have social stealth the stealth is damn fantastic if u turn on guaranteed assassinations. So many hiding spots there are grappling spots on ceilings you can hide in boxes on the ground or tuck into a wardrobe. And, Since u can prone now u can utilize not just big bushes but smaller grass patches. Aswell as staying prone in shallow water and breathing through a tube too wait until someone comes near the pond your in. Or during the night you can hide in plain sight with the splinter cell esque light play its awesome Naoe is also really fast so you can get to someone a lil far even when there about to notice you and take em out. Combat with Yasuke was def alot of fun slashing people down. His kabuto is one of my favorite weapons in the game besides the tanto and hidden blade combo because both of those have fantastic abilites. I love the kabutos backbreaker and jumping smash abilites and the tanto has the best one being a mid combat assassination so if u get caught in stealth u can re enter it if u have the ability ready without having to fully enter combat pretty fire. One of the things i wasn't expecting was being able to customize gear piece by piece from gear u collect so your Katana or, any other weapon is unique to you. Your able to choose the handle, the hand-guard, the blade, and sheathe for a Katana and for like the Kusarigama u can change the blade, handle, chain, and weight at the end. It's a very cool system for gear so your weapons will just get better and better looking when u find  weapons with cooler parts. Instead of just sticking with the one cool weapon visual until you find something cooler u get your own unique weapon visual that keeps getting better as you go and i think that is actually a really really cool mechanic. All my weapons look clean and exactly how i would want them too. Besides all that the graphics are good but that's expected. It's the same RPG level stuff so if you don't like that style either don't get it, use wemod and cheat your level, or get used to it. The skill trees are nice cause there's 6 different skill trees for both so 12 total but annoying that u have to get knowledge points to go to the next rank for more skills. It's only the orange icons that give them and they are relativley boring and grindy things. I only ever got 1 or 2 knowledge points through the story and it was when u were forced to pray at shrines so you would complete a shrine and get a points kind of a shitty system imo. last but not least to everyone the game is not bad cause there's a black man or a gay romance. Its bad because the actual story around the characters and how the treat the brotherhood is bad. My rating Stealth 9/10 Story 2/10 Overall 5/10.

Also nice that you can reward mastery points at any time for free and rebuild your character. 

Typical Ubisoft bugs, little bit of ragdolling here and there, sometimes enemies get confused and just stand there. Also, you can't really fight on steps, so if an enemy is coming downstairs, and you get too close to the stairs, you'll start walking up and you guys will just casually pass each other.   Horseriding overall is solid, some minor annoyances with the horse rearing up and getting confused if it runs too close to a lamp post.

[b] Characters: [/b]
Both have very different play styles, Naoe is the traditional Assassin feeling character whose story, while a bit cliche is also very engaging. Yasuke is more akin to the Bruiser Assassin's utilized in other games by characters like Ezio or Arno.

[b] Setting: [/b]
Japan in absolutely stunning. The visuals are upgraded further from Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins. Vibrancy, seasonal changes, the harsh rains in the lush forests. It envelopes you and when you step into a small town or bustling city you feel the tonal shift in the surroundings.

[b] Story: [/b]
I'm a little over 6 hours in and feel I've only scratched the surface in the best way possible. I'm engrossed in the story, I want to see it to the end just based on the first couple of hours. While I may be 6 hours in, a majority of it is exploration and getting lost in the beauty of the world only to be pulled back into the story at a shrine or stumbling upon a quest.

Whether you're being agile, stealthy, and an overall true blue assassin or if you're the powerhouse that is Yasuke with his brute strength and dominating figure. The combat feels fluid and really well polished. The assassination animations, the finishers, parrying or dodging, they feel like we've been listened to and given something that instead of being rushed out has been sitting on the pottery wheel being polished to a shine.

[h2] Play it yourself, don't pre-judge based on others [/h2]
This is the biggest thing. I was almost dissuaded by the negative nancys out there that are consistently bashing the game. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it the initial Japan setting we thought we'd get when II, Brotherhood, Revelations, and III released? No, but it is a slight return to form with engaging characters, and engrossing story, and it feels like Ubisoft is attempting to bring it back to form slowly but surely.

191040920,english,"One step forward, one step to the side.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is a highlight of the franchise for me after what I had experienced in Valhalla. The stealth and combat feel much better than the rest of the RPG series with the more grounded abilities, even if the NPC AI hasn't really caught up. You don't feel like a god, you feel like a glass canon as Naoe and a brick shit house as Yaskue. 

The world itself is beautiful, the engine upgrade is clear to see when you're walking besides dense forests blowing in the breeze. The world doesn't feel as alive as a game like Red Dead Redemption 2, but there are still plenty of side activities and NPCs to come across.

The story is a bit of a sore spot as there is very little to do with the modern day story, while the in-game story feels a shallow if you're just going through the main story quests, of which I think there are too many. It feels like there is too much of everything as the game once again uses the formula of ""Kill X amount of masked enemies that are part of a secret order and not directly tied to the templars"" and I for one am getting rather tired of it. They could've chopped the amount of people to kill in half and it would've held my attention for much longer.

Overall i'd call the game a solid 7/10, the stealth and world kept me engaged when the story started to wane. I'd wait for a sale a year down the line, you'll get a lot more bang for your buck by then.",True,0,0,1742779718,76561198151636032,2953

It's been 31 hours and I've only finally gotten Yasuke as a party member lol, because I spent a lot of time exploring around and getting those mastery points up. Everything is great so far, don't listen to the crybabies and racists out there. If you liked similar AC games, you will like this.
Do yourself a favour and play the game with the JP dub and ENG sub- ENG dubs are usually terrible whenever applied to anything Asian - in games like in anime etc. No offense to the voice actors but there's no comparison really, it's a hundred times better with the JP dub, it just fits more.

My only complaint so far is: the environment is beautiful and very realistic - sometimes too much!
Forests are VERY thick and kind of a pain to navigate through most of the times, and night time is VERY dark (read: black) to the point you can't see ANYTHING most of the times.

Someone else seems to find other bugs as well (maybe fixed already, or I had already the latest Ubisoft connector installed because of Avatar).

Points for ability to listen Japanese instead of English (which kind of would ruin the experience).

Second bug / poorly functioning thing is that parkour works as bad as all other Assassins games (no big surprise on that).

The odd thing is that game works smoothly with old drivers (reminds of updating on every start), minimum system requirements. way much better that e.g. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, where minimum requirements are same than in this Assassins Greed Shadows. Both run on SSD.

- On expert, I do appreciate the slight upgrade to enemy awareness, being able to be spotted on a roof to some may seem annoying but I appreciate the added layer of thought when sneaking around enemy bases.

Neutrals
- The story is okay so far, still working my way through it.
- As per usual with most Assassin’s Creed games some side activities do start to feel a little repetitive.

Cons
- Dub voice acting could be better, it’s not atrocious but it’s not amazing either. 
- I’m not a fan of the amount of forest in this game, sliding down hills while trying to get to a point on the map is a little annoying the amount of trees and bushes in transit to towns feels excessive at times.

191037179,english,"I've been a long time Assassin's Creed fan, but mostly a fan of their classic library of games ranging from Assassin's Creed 1 to Syndicate. I'm one of the Players that was initially turned off by the series' departure into RPG territory, and for that reason, I haven't completed a single AC game since Syndicate. I skipped Origins, skipped Odyssey, Mirage and Valhalla, but decided to come back to the series after a long hiatus for Shadows. I'm just shy of 15 hours into the game, and so far I am very impressed. Forget what you heard, ignore the haters, ignore the absolutely vapid and absurd culture war ""controversies"" surrounding this game. Assassin's Creed Shadows will go down in history as one of the biggest and best games ever made.

It's not for everybody, but I'm enthralled. The game looks, feels and plays just like a Japanese martial arts movie. The tone of the cut scenes, the pacing, the camera work, etc., and watching Yasuke and Naoe's stories play out gives me a distinctly nostalgic feeling of watching steely martial arts movies akin to 13 Assassins.

Obviously, with this being an Assassin's Creed game, it goes without saying that the world map is vast, beautiful, and incredible to explore. From riding across the country side on horse back, to scaling huge castles to reach vantage points, to taking a boat down the river, to getting lost wandering through twisting caves to uncover their secrets, there is endless terrain to explore in this game, to the point that it's somewhat daunting. However, there is never a moment where you won't want to stop and marvel at the sheer amount of detail, effort, and time the developers took into bringing feudal Japan to life.

The combat in the game works well enough, although it can feel clunky and unpolished at times, thanks to the camera. When you're facing off against several enemies at once, and trying to rotate the camera to keep everyone in view and position your character to prevent yourself from being surrounded and back attacked, the camera will often bump into a wall, or a random tree, and end up zooming in too close to the battle making it hard to plan, strategize, and streamline your attacks. Its easy to get flanked and cheap shotted by enemies that were just out of view, leading to lots of leaping and rolling around to re-position yourself just so you can see every threat. That, however, makes the stealth game all the more preferable, as Assassin's Creed at it's core is about stealth game play and avoiding open combat whenever possible.

The game mechanics here haven't much changed since the beginning. There's still lots of diving into random piles of straw, hiding in the tall grass, stalking enemies from the rooftops in Eagle vision and whistling your way to victory one curious mark at a time. Veteran fans of the series will immediately feel comfortable in their planning and execution, while traversing areas full of patrolling guards to reach designated targets, and making use of the environment to plan ambushes and the like.

The only trouble I had in this area was getting used to the new control scheme. Full disclosure, as I said in the beginning, I skipped every entry in the series since Origins, so I don't know if the current control scheme is what they've been using for the most recent games, but prior to playing Shadows, I had spent the last few weeks playing Syndicate, which had been on my back burner of ""to play"" games for the last ten years! The classic Assassin's Creed games used the X or Square button, for XBox / PC and Playstation Players respectively, to attack enemies and perform assassinations from hiding spots, and used the shoulder buttons for climbing and traversal. Shadows' control scheme is exactly the opposite of that, with no option to revert to a classic control scheme. It took me about 10 hours to ""unlearn"" the old controls and finally get comfortable and consistent with the new controls, although I have to admit that fighting using the shoulder buttons just feels weird. Several times I ended up getting whacked due to pressing the wrong button. I would intend to assassinate an enemy investigating my hiding spot, just to stand up straight and say ""Hi!"" due to the X button now being mapped to crouch and uncrouch!

But after training myself to get used to the modern controls, I can honestly say that that's when my game really started. With newfound confidence in my abilities, I found myself quickly adapting to changing situations and making less mistakes, until I was out and about raiding Bandit camps and stealing all of their supplies, sneaking into castles at night to reach high vantage points and scouting out the area, and feeling more comfortable taking on and dispatching enemies a few ranks higher than me.

When you play games like this, you kind of settle into a role that comes naturally to your own style of game play. I decided I would be an honorable Assassin with a code. I found myself refusing to kill indiscriminately, sparing guards that otherwise would have been an easy target, and reaching my objectives without leaving a trail of bloodshed whenever possible. The point being, this is absolutely the type of immersive game that draws you into the game's world, and makes you feel like you're a real part of it's environment. Each and every Player is going to forge their own path here, and the game comes with a wealth of customization options that allows for untold levels of freedom of style and game play. Every weapon, every piece of clothing, your hide out, even down to your horse, everything is customizable, to the point that it almost feels overwhelming, but in a good way.

In the end, I find myself WANTING to see Naoe succeed. I WANT to see what kind of resolution and partnership she ultimately develops with Yasuke. I WANT to see both characters grow, and become more powerful, more influential, and more adept and more skilled as time goes on. More importantly, playing Shadows honestly makes me want to return to the series wholeheartedly to find out what I've been missing. Now I want to go back and try out Odyssey, and Valhalla, and I think perhaps I judged those games too harshly. Which brings me to my final point.

It is unfortunate, and downright sad that so many people these days let themselves get caught up in this miserable culture war nonsense that seems to plague every corner of entertainment media. Assassin's Creed Shadows is a great game, a fun game, a deep game, and it's clear to most fans, I believe, that the developers put undeserved amounts of time and work into this entry in the series. I'm just going to say it outright. The people who are hating on this game, claiming the reviews are paid, and spend all of their time creating new social media accounts to post laugh reacts on every post have simply been lied to, and they are the victims of their own bias. I recommend this game to anyone that likes good games with vast open worlds, immersive game play, and strong stories, that has the time to invest in it to appreciate it for what it is.

Since Assassin’s Creed 2 or 3, I haven’t been able to finish an Assassin’s Creed game.

The story is told in such a boring way, with such repetitive gameplay that I just give up early in the game. Because if it’s already this repetitive at the beginning, imagine having to endure that all the way to the end.

The way the characters interact with each other during dialogues is terrible. It feels like nothing really matters—except during some well-produced cutscenes. And even in those, there’s this sense of lacking dynamism, poor scriptwriting, and bad use of time (scenes that could be much shorter end up dragging on way too long).

At first, I was even emotionally invested in Naoe’s story, but it’s told so slowly and poorly, with “delays” between each part, no dynamism—it’s really weird.

So yeah, the graphics are good, but the gameplay and the way the story progresses are terrible.

191033677,english,"Didn't play that much yet, but from what I've experienced so far, this is a new technical milestone. No performance issues and it truly feels like next-gen (if you have the hardware for it). This game demands more than other contenders, but unlike titles like MH Wilds that are just badly optimized, this one actually delivers - with astonishing graphics, sound, and physics.

To be frank, my FPS sometimes drop below 60, which means they actually dip below 30 since I'm using frame generation. But I'm also running the full ultra preset with full ray tracing. There are quite a few settings that can drastically improve performance, but I've decided to leave them maxed out because I want to enjoy the full show. Under normal conditions I get around 70-110 FPS. So before you start complaining, reduce the graphics options to match the level of other games. In this game, ultra means it looks like nothing you've seen before.

I've always wondered why we tend to rush through game environments while we take our time wandering in real-life forests. The answer is pretty simple: virtual worlds rarely match the richness and uniqueness of the real one. But in AC Shadows, I actually want to go slow. I find myself walking most of the time - and somehow, that alone is fun. The world feels so real, it's surreal, haha. I'm confident the rest of the game will hold up too, especially if it follows in the footsteps of its predecessors.

Compared to Rise of the Ronin (which I also enjoy), it's clear how much graphics and sound design can boost immersion. AC Shadows isn't just a place to play, it's a place to be.

I find myself fully immersed in the story, taking my time to appreciate the rich historical elements and real-life lore woven into the game. The Codex entries add an extra layer of depth, making the experience feel even more authentic.

As for microtransactions, I don’t find them to be an issue since they’re entirely optional (though I wouldn’t say no to a tiger mount!). However, one thing that absolutely needed to be addressed was the lack of instant assassinations. It felt frustrating to sneak up on an enemy, perform an ""assassination,"" only for them to stand right back up. I’m glad the developers listened and added this feature.

Naoe is easily my favorite Assassin's Creed protagonist in recent years—Kassandra comes close, but Naoe’s character and story really stand out.

Overall, this game is a fantastic addition to the series, and I highly recommend taking the time to fully immerse yourself in its world.

Read the negative reviews, they are all people complaining about a fantasy game series not being ""100% authentic"", people who hate the Ubisoft launcher and/or they have potato PCs and can't get the PC to work (their problem), or the latter camp that hates Ubisoft games/ monetization strategy, or call inclusive games ""woke"". I get it, they all have DLC, but its OPTIONAL, like nobody forces you to buy some lore-breaking shiny medieval armor or tie-in game sword. Does it follow the Ubisoft formula, absolutely. But it's not a cut and paste, like every game it has a slight tweak to the formula and the overall amount of ADHD collectibles peppering the map are much less.

This is it fam- Japanese Assassin's Creed is here. Does it beat Odyssey? Is it as good as Valhalla? (Yes, I loved Valhalla too. Deal with it.) This game takes a similar formula but refines it with better combat and a world that is just as immersive thus far. The story is the now typical hunt down a handful of bad people learning more about them as you go to unravel the overarching story. I'd say its a cross between Valhalla and Odyssey in that regard. Not as many people as Valhalla, and more than Odyssey and Mirage. You're also kinda fighting for your own personal revenge with an interesting twist of two opposite characters working together for a common goal.

The world is open and interesting, but also more compact so you aren't just running around for years in an empty world, (looking at you, Origins). There's the standard collectibles but I don't know why it just hits different when you are meditating so you can learn about the story for a legitimate story reason, instead of randomly stacking rocks in a frustrating mini-game (looking at you, Valhalla).

I've played all of the recent games, most of the old ones, and I can say Shadows brings the best of both world's together. If you absolutely hate where Assassin's Creed went in recent years, (you're wrong, btw) but you may find Shadows will bring you back. It's not necessarily a recent game + an old game. But it's definitely a recent game + Mirage in that it more closely resembles the older games.  Or hell, just play Yasuke and forget you're even playing Assassin's Creed.

Either way the game is a blast and immersive for us weebs. You know you are. Embrace it.

Critiques? I think the combat is a bit too much like the old games in the sense that its a bit punishing, and a bit too much like the new games in that your equipment matters so you have to keep upgrading things. I personally loved the modern day segments, that seems to be gone thus far, in Shadows with just a tiny splatter at the beginning of the game. I used to love the weird modern/futuristic/sci-fi vibes, but I'll survive. I think the game would feature a lot less criticism if it had launched for $10 less, but it seems like all the big games are now $69.99 so while I hate it, it isn't unique to Ubisoft. This is the smoothest and best looking Assassin's Creed to date and I think the extra time in the oven really led to a better product in the end.",True,0,0,1742769200,76561198049005676,623

191030537,english,"I am absolutely blown away by Assassin’s Creed Shadows! This game takes everything that made the series great and pushes it to new heights in every possible way. From the moment you step into the world, you're transported to a dark, atmospheric setting where every shadow holds a secret and every decision feels meaningful. Ubisoft has truly outdone themselves here, creating an experience that is not only breathtaking visually but also rich in narrative depth and gameplay innovation.

First, let’s talk about the atmosphere. The world in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is something truly special. It’s a seamless blend of dark alleyways, bustling marketplaces, and majestic rooftops that all feel alive and full of history. The attention to detail is incredible—every building, every corner, every texture feels meticulously crafted. The lighting system is particularly impressive, with shadows playing a crucial role in your ability to navigate the world. The way light and darkness interact is not just a visual tool, but a core part of the gameplay itself. You’ll find yourself taking advantage of the shadows to slip past guards or stay hidden as you execute your next move.

The story is where Assassin’s Creed Shadows really shines. While it remains deeply rooted in the rich lore of the Assassin's Creed universe, it introduces a fresh narrative that is gripping from start to finish. The protagonist is an entirely new character with a complex backstory that makes you invest emotionally in their journey. The game strikes a perfect balance between personal stakes and global consequences, leaving you constantly wondering how your choices will affect the larger world. The writing is sharp, the dialogues are meaningful, and the voice acting is phenomenal. It’s a story that is both thrilling and thought-provoking, with plot twists that will leave you speechless.

Gameplay-wise, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a masterpiece. The stealth mechanics have been completely overhauled, and the result is nothing short of spectacular. The fluidity with which your character moves through the environment is a true joy to experience. Whether you're scaling walls, blending into crowds, or silently taking down enemies, every action feels seamless and natural. The addition of new gadgets and tools allows for even more creative ways to approach missions. You can now choose to sneak through undetected, use distraction tactics, or engage in thrilling parkour sequences that keep you on your toes. The level of freedom in how you choose to tackle each objective is astonishing, and every player will find their own preferred playstyle.

Combat has also been refined, making it both strategic and satisfying. It’s not just about brute force; timing, positioning, and quick reflexes all come into play. The dynamic combat system offers smooth transitions between weapons, stealth kills, and counter-attacks, making every fight feel unique and rewarding. And the new animations are just gorgeous—you can feel the weight and impact of every move.

The open-world design is another standout feature. Unlike previous entries in the franchise, Assassin’s Creed Shadows encourages exploration with a sense of discovery that’s hard to find elsewhere. The world is vast and full of hidden treasures, side quests, and unexpected encounters that never feel like filler. Whether you’re following the main story or getting lost in the rich side content, there’s always something new to uncover. The cities are alive with NPCs going about their daily lives, and the dynamic world reacts to your actions in ways that make the experience feel truly immersive.

And let’s not forget about the visuals. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a graphical masterpiece. The environments are stunning, with breathtaking vistas and incredibly detailed cityscapes. The lighting and shadow work are second to none, creating a truly cinematic experience. The character models are highly detailed, and the animations are fluid, making every moment feel lifelike.

In summary, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph. It takes the core elements of the franchise—stealth, exploration, and storytelling—and elevates them to new heights with a fresh perspective. The game is beautifully crafted, the story is emotionally engaging, and the gameplay is incredibly satisfying. Ubisoft has set a new standard for open-world games with this one. If you’re a fan of the series or just someone who enjoys a great story and thrilling gameplay, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a must-play. Don’t miss out on this masterpiece! It might be the best Assassins Creed of all time...",True,0,0,1742768197,76561198993093383,1384

Might aswell say it the dialogue is kind of lacking that is if you listen to it in english but the devs advise you to change it to immersive mode.
I play with immersive mode on, cannon off and guided exploration off call me crazy but for me it works.
The visuals are exquisite
The music is really nice 
The story is kind of interesting even if it gets repetitive sometimes all you need to do are some side quests that might immerse you in other perspectives of the game.
I did not register any problems with the ubisoft connect I don't even notice it when it starts and tbh progressing in the game and getting free in game currency does not sound that bad.
While addressing the micro-transactions did not even know they were there till the game was like here some money brows the shop now. Not like it impacts the game at all, 
The fights are really cool if you are into the ninja stuff the game gives you kind of a free reign on how to play it the only shitty part is that if you want a specific weapon you either progress in the game or consider yourself lucky to get it from an npc.
Got stuck in a tree at one point going down a mountain and that's about the worst thing that happened to me in the game so I can't hate on it coz there is ubisoft connect or coz there it a black character in the game.
The optimization is ok no stuttering or anything.
I might be just old or smt but I like it ill play it some more and the fact that I pre-ordered it and now i get a 40$ free dlc rly does not sound that bad.

191029253,english,"I actually like the story (from the very limited time I've gotten to play so far) and the gameplay. Yes, there are some problems with the game, but it's a fun game to play when you want to relax or see the what Japan was in that era. Still with the exploration and adventure, it doesn't come close to the older Assassin Creed games that you feel when playing them, especially Assassin Creed Black Flag. 

One of the main issues I've encountered with the game is the fog over the map. While I understand the design choice of encouraging players to explore the world and discover things, I find it pretty frustrating. For example, in Assassin's Creed Origins, the map would automatically clear when you go to that region, allowing you to easily see the entire region. But in this game, that's not the case. Instead, you need to manually uncover the fog by exploring each area yourself, which can feel like a grind.

Unfogging the entire map ends up taking around 65 hours in this game, which feels like a significant time investment, especially when the fog hinders your ability to navigate and see the region you in. The game is fantastic overall, but this aspect definitely drags the experience down. Having to run through mountains, swim through water, and explore every inch of the map just to clear the fog feels like an unnecessary chore.

It would be great if the developers could patch this and make it so that the map clears more naturally, like in previous games. I personally like to uncover the entire map before diving into the story, and with this system, it just makes the process a lot longer and more tedious.

To be honest, this game is an B rate for me.
If you are interested to play, better to wait for a discount or wait until they fix the game

191028557,english,"**A Short Review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows After 20 Hours of Gameplay**  

### **Pros:**  
1. Great world-building.  
2. Insane physics system—one of the best in the series, especially the new weather system.  
3. Naoe’s gameplay is fantastic; her combat and movement system align perfectly with a shinobi (ninja). Easily one of the best ninja gameplay experiences in any game.  
4. Yusuke’s gameplay is not boring at all. His finishing moves look great.  
5. Combat is excellent, especially for Naoe.  

The story mainly revolves around Naoe, while Yusuke serves as a complement to the narrative. You can complete almost the entire game playing as Naoe, except for some scripted Yusuke sections.  

### **Cons:**  
1. As a shinobi, Naoe doesn’t have the ability to fight with a bow, which feels odd.  
2. The game is quite long—I think I’ll need at least 40 more hours to finish it.  
3. Very demanding on PC. It requires ray-traced diffuse lighting everywhere to look good. But on ultra settings, it’s one of the best-looking games out there.  

### **Controversy Around the Game**  
This level of hate reminds me of only two other times:  
- The first was *The Last of Us Part II*, which is a great game, lol.  
- The second is *Dragon Age: Veilguard*, though I haven’t played it.  

Now, with *Assassin’s Creed Shadows*, the hate feels forced, lol. If you’re unsure, just buy it on Steam. If you don’t like it, you can refund the game as long as your playtime is under two hours.  

8/10.

It's far from being the best game ever, it's just okay, it also doesn't feel like an assassin's creed game... I'm not a fan of assassin's creed games but I enjoyed and finished quite a few, like unity or valhalla. 
This game's map is huge visual improvement to previous ubi games, the open world is very big, not as big as valhalla but still huge and varied and also very open, and you can spend a lot of time just exploring nicely made places and landscapes.
Some negative youtubers say you can't climb up steep mountains because you slide down so you have to circles mountains, well then just walk uphill like a snake and you'll reach most inaccessible places, it is completely possible to cross a mountain even with horse.
The negative side of the game is the story, it's very mid, it feels way to often like a cut-scene simulator with high budget, there is also some historical accuracy controversy visible if you read history books and not just rewritten wikipedia, but if you don't care, at the end of the day it's just a fictional game.

191023580,english,"This game is really quite amazing in many ways. It does a lot of things wells. My favorite part is how well the stealth and combat works. The hard mode feels especially rewarding for those who take their time and use strategy rather than brute force. While some enemies do get more health than normal, there are ways to heavily handicap that health pool through cunning before initiating formal combat. Even without guaranteed assassination turned on, you can get armor and engravings that put your assassination abilities into overdrive only leaving room for survival to the most elite enemies you come across. I don't feel punished for having to engage in normal combat for some enemies since the weapon are all really fun to use but definitely  pick your battles, because on higher difficulties or you will regret it. Gone are the days where only one enemy will attack you at once.

The graphics are stunning. I have a desktop and a laptop. My laptop isn't as strong as my desktop, but even with every setting turned down to the lowest so that I can still play road on my laptop with a steady 60fps everything still looks amazing. On my desktop I can crank everything up to high and its so visually impressive and optimized, a true next gen game.

I have varying opinions about different parts of the story I've witnessed so far, but no major complaints. I am playing on immersion mode which keeps the games vocals in Japanese/Portuguese where their respective languages matter the most and English subtitles. These actors did a great job is all I can say.

I know one the biggest thing going around on the internet has been why is there a black guy in japan and that he is gay. First off, I get zero vibes that the man is gay, and if that option appears later to either reveal it or allow the player to pursue that choice, its probably completely optional and has very little or nothing to do with almost anything going on in this games world setting. So for all the people who didn't want to play the game because of homosexuality, after 31 hours of having an absolute blast I haven't seen it once. Some games, which I won't name but received incredible praise had far more of it in there and no one batted an eye. And as far as, why is there a black guy in japan? It would spoil the story if I told you, but it makes sense and isn't some crappy ret-con. Also while playing as him is an entirely different play-style, for the majority of the game so far it has been entirely optional, but at the same time interesting.

Another thing people complained about was the micro-transactions. You literally have to go to another menu to even see them. Everything is cosmetic, or an overpowered armor set that is completely optional and would otherwise trivialize the game. You 100% do not need to spend any money on the game other than what you paid to play it. And if you absolutely must have a story item, you can grind slowly to get a free currency and buy something from a rotating shop similar to Helldivers 2.

As a final note I'd like to mention a lot of things I heard about the game made me almost not buy it. I was lied to by many people about things that actually didn't matter, or had almost zero impact on the game. I've been having a lot of fun and I'm glad I bought this game. No I wasn't paid to write this, no I am not a Ubisoft fanboy and finally the game is ACTUALLY GOOD and plan to put many more hours into this as I'm barely into Act 2. This game is HUGE with tons to do and explore. Don't let the lies stop you from having a good time. ",True,0,0,1742762327,76561197999483752,3286

My biggest complaint is that they spent like no time optimizing it. Like seriously. I have it set to 720p and it still only gets like 40 fps on my intel arc a750. Instead of relying on upscalers and framegen, I wish they had made it run better. Especially because it runs more smoothly on my steam deck than my pc. It stutters a lot on this graphics card, but doesn't on the less powerful, steam deck. What the heck... 
The game is fun, and can look beautiful... if you aren't playing it on the lowest settings in 720p...

It doesn't have as much attention to detail as say, RDR2, which is sad, and it leaves something to be wanted features wise. I do really think that they should have focused on the ninja part, and stopped making assassins creed so focused on combat. Sure it can be fun, but I want to be sneaky and have more stealth skills. Sure, an assassin should be able to fight back, but they could have made the stealth takedowns more interesting and varied, or alternatively, made them feel impactful like the sound effects they used to use in like Black Flag, and the swift assassinations that went with them.

Story is significantly better than most AC games. It's more personal, moving and stupid assassin/animus bs is kept to minimum. Both characters are introduced in interesting way and despite political mess around them, they actually fit in the story and both are written well. 

However they don't always work so good as playable characters. Naoe is nimble, stealthy, but has no proper ranged attacks and is glass cannon. While Yasuke is slow tank that Hulk smashes everything, but have difficulties climbing, hiding. The way you have to approach objectives with each character is different and freshens up gameplay in main story missions, but in open world roaming the whole concept falls apart. It makes sense that both have limitations, but most times I really do miss one man army power fantasy character that can do everything. Yasuke messes up the whole AC concept and turns game into a brawler. Not to mention that he is utterly useless outside boss fights. The biggest issue here is that lot of open world objectives require you to climb places, and giant heavy armor tank covered in weapons don't climb very well. Also you cannot swap between characters in restricted locations. If you have to gather something on rooftops or assassinate targets, always pick Naoe. She is typical AC character minus the bow. 

Combat is good, intuitive. There are not to many unique active skills, but most of the fights consists of different combos that you can unlock in skill tree. Fights are really brutal. You can chop off body parts. ACS took out Ubi game's typical enemy tagging by drone. This time, you have to find enemies yourself and sneak all around fortresses to see what's behind different walls or go in blind. This new approach forces you to improvise more, since quite often you will run into enemies you did not spot while surveying the place. 

Entire detection system has been updated. Now Enemies actually have to see or hear you to attack you. That keeps combat within fortresses localized. Entire place will not go after you if only couple guards spot you. It is possible to adjust stealth difficulty so that AI can see you everywhere within their cone of vision, including vertically. Even if you are above on the ledge in front of them. Forcing you to move around even more and change tactics on the fly.

While the combat has been improved, movement feels worse. Traversing rooftops, jumping on/off places is slow and way worse thanks to improved stealth mechanics that require you to be quick and coordinated. Also it is possible to use your climbing hook only in pre-defined places limiting movement. And Yasuke does not have climbing hook at all.

You cannot clear fortresses. Enemies keep respawning when you fast travel. Which makes it feel like you are not really doing any progression on the map other than ticking checkboxes. Interaction with wild animals is missing. You cannot hunt or be attacked by them. There are not even bears in the game. Devs tried to explain this lack of feature with respect to culture, but it's clearly just an excuse, as Ghost of Tsushima showed.    

There is disconnect between the things game asks you to do and tools it provides. It tries to be more immersive and asks of you to explore and find things yourself from description, but at the same time gives you target's location with press of a button. With one button press you can see through walls where are the items you supposed to find. Or it asks you to find person by following instructions, while giving you scout mechanic, which literally points on map exactly where the target is. It wants you to explore and figure things out yourself, but also thinks you are to dumb to accomplish anything without training wheels. It defeats the purpose of those features.

Dramatic weather adds a lot to atmosphere and is nice new addition to series. Reminds of Witcher 3 weather system. Paths, farms, villages all feel natural, lived-in and believable. Except for some unclimbable hills that require you to go long way around, stay on nicely crafted paths instead of looking for shortcuts through forests. 

Graphics can vary wildly. It can look gorgeous if your system can run it, but optimization is not great. Unless you have a very expensive GPU, you will be looking at a blurry image and muddy textures, if you want your game to run smoothly. ACS does not scale very well and have mandatory Ray Tracing. On 3060Ti to make it look good you will have to run native 30-40fps with framegen to 60-80fps and play with controller to not feel input lag. Otherwise it will all be blurry and look significantly worse than Witcher 3. DLSS looks significantly better than FSR in this title. FPS in cutscenes is always 30fps or fewer no matter the settings.

UI was designed for looks, not conveniency. Especially on ultra wide screens. The new animus menu system is horrendous nonsensical mess. ACS UI has tons of pointless time wasters, popups etc that just slow things down. Devs don't respect your time. Even map loads several seconds each time you open it, like it's trying to sync the progress to slow Ubi servers. Speaking of which Ubi servers are barely working and give error messages in single player game. As for MTXs, just ignore them. They can't hurt you.

Leveling, skills and inventory system hasn't changed since Origins. It's pretty much the same here. It has simple base building, reminiscence of AC2. Upgrading buildings in it will give you passive bonuses.

English voice over is really bad. Many actors don't feel right for the roles. Vocal expressions and emotions don't match up with animations. There's certain detachment from how lines are delivered and what is happening in scenes. Sometimes characters will even be voiced by AI or different voice actor in couple sentences during same conversation. It's jarring and immersion breaking. You will be far better off playing with immersive mode turned on (audio settings), which turns all VOs into Japanese and Portuguese. 

Music is very good and interesting. It will sometimes switch from calm traditional few instrument Japanese background sounds to something right out of 80s kung fu movies with electric guitars and electronics. 

Despite some shortcomings, this could be one of the better AC games. It's definitely better than Valhalla. You are still gonna play the same way you did Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla. It is an Ubisoft game after all and they have their formula. But when it comes to smaller details, ACS is more creative, varied and captivating than previous few. It does not do immersive beautiful feudal Japan better than Ghost of Tsushima, but it borrows few ideas from it. Time wasting grind of map completion is still there, and the packaging is nicer this time. Splitting character abilities between two is not the best idea, but Naoe is basically your regular Ezio, so just ignore Yasuke. If you like that one game Ubisoft has, here's another one, but it will probably run and play better on console.

1. They completely deleted all of the good Assassin Mechanics from the last games.

2. The Armor Upgrade Mechanics from Valhalla were great, so they deleted that

3. Everything you do is: go there, fetch or fight or (bad) dialoge after 30 seconds...quest completed--->???? even the very bad side quest from valhalla were FAR more entertaining

4. No real world Story so far.. seems they deleted that

5. you have to do repetetive very boring ""find 2 or 3 scrolls"" quest to level up your available character Skills

6. Main Chars are both completely boring, Eivor and nearly every previous was sooo much better

Including map unlocks and progression purchases is even more cringe for SP. classic Ubisoft. Overall character politics isn’t my favorite feels forced. Some of the development feels lazy and repetitive wish there had been some more diversity in boss fights.

191017918,english,"A mixed recommendation for a good stealth game buried under systems stretched far too thin. For every nicely executed story beat and cutscene there is two confusing plotlines that magically tie themselves closed with little to no explanation. For every fun enemy base to sneak in and out of there is AI inside that is incapable of doing anything to you if you turn around and run for 5 seconds after being spotted. For every questline with a unique premise there are ten where you go somewhere and kill people. 

Ubisoft really needs to realize that large amounts of content do not equal a good game. If this game had a map 1/3 of the size, with 1/5 as many quests and people to kill, we'd have a very solid game on our hands. There are two ends of a spectrum that Ubi is trying to please, with one end simply wanting to turn its brain off and kill people, and the other wanting a full enveloping story with realistic characters and setting. They cannot please both and most of their attempts to do so result in comically bad whiplash again and again. 

Game is not worth $70 dollars. Maybe $35 unless you are really craving a stealth experience. Stealth is by far the strongest part of this game, so I do not regret my time with it because of my strong liking for the stealth genre.

  Cutscenes are in 30fps but i honestly don't notice.  I reccomend the immersive mode (with japanese voices), even tho you sometimes have to read subs while playing.

  Also you can use a mod to improve performance, and another to remove the stupid white line around you when hidden plus more.

191017698,english,"This one is very difficult to recommend. It’s almost identical to AC Valhalla, but worse.

Difficulty is a joke while playing Naoe. While playing Yasuke... you just kill everything and soak all damage—no need for evasion or blocking. He’s just unstoppable.
It is stupid to lock some content behind different characters in this situation. The only new and good thing this game introduces is the shadows mechanic and how it works with stealth—but Yasuke can't do stealth...
Yasuke is a good character, but he is so overpowered and has no stealth. I don't understand why I would play him? To skip the game? Then it's better not to buy it.
The gearing system is a downgrade from Valhalla back to Odyssey. At least gear doesn’t matter in this game, and upgrading it is cheap.
Exploration and looting is some kind of stupid joke. In chests I get stones, gravel, dirt, bushes... that I can't even sell. Where is the gear? At least heart doesn’t matter in this game.
Cutscenes are horrendously bad—a big downgrade from Valhalla. Characters often move like robots. 31 FPS look, widescreen format, and the depth of field is atrocious (and you can't disable it).

Just to summarise what is new and good:
- The visual fidelity isn’t much of an improvement over Valhalla, but the setting is definitely better—Japanese sakuras are far more appealing than British swamps.
- Render quality of gear. But of course, since they want to sell you more microtransactions in a solo game...
- Shadows mechanic is a welcome addition to the game.
- For the first time in the reboot of AC games, the protagonist actually has motivation.

There is no reason to play this game if you not played Valhalla witch is cheaper, has more content and more fulfilling. Better to wait 66-80% discount on this title.

191017535,english,"Summary:
I can't stop myself from playing this game. I think we've all seen Ubisoft at it's worst over the course of the past few years, failing to prioritize players, making cash grabs, and using this series as a means to get quick cash from a devoted set of players. I've been playing this series since it came out, and I have to say after my 24 hours in the game so far, this is Ubisoft at it's best. Ubisoft if you read this, don't take this win as a means to settle. Keep innovating in your games, like I can tell you did in this one. Don't go back to copy-pasting mechanics just because you know players liked the last game.

Music:
Why are you starting with music? BECAUSE IT'S SO SO SO GOOD. The music score for this game is just incredible, kudos to the composers. It keeps everything feeling fresh, it occurs in the right moments in the game, and amplifies each combat sequence, and each piece of storytelling.

Characters:
The game plays like a movie, and I'm even enjoying Yasuke (despite thinking initially, I would not play as him). Yasuke's back story is equally as interesting as Naoe's, and I recommend spending just a little time on him throughout your play through, he's a beast when fighting large groups. Main Characters in the story feel very memorable, and I'm finding myself impressed and excited when cinematics start as opposed to picking up my phone, like I would in most games.

Combat:
Combat is massively improved, finishers are so fun, and I found my chin hitting the floor after seeing them for the first time. They don't really get old because they're so incredibly brutal. Stealth gameplay is awesome, the grappling hook is such a cool change for moving around the play area, and prone is equally as impactful. I've had so much fun with it. Build diversity is stellar, and so far I'm picking up new weapons to play with regularly, and changing my build out as often as I can just to play with new tools. 

Story:
I'm only 24 hours in as of right now, and I have done a TON of side content. So I don't imagine I'm super far into the story. That said, I'm really enjoying it. I'll come back to this after finishing the game.

Graphics:
Graphics are stellar on a 4070, especially with DLSS enabled. It really smooths out the game, and I'm playing on 4k. The environments are beautiful, diverse, and man the WIND simulation is so good. I never thought watching wind blow tons of leaves around would immerse me as much as it has for whatever stupid reason lol.",True,0,0,1742757663,76561198092113913,2980

191017304,english,"I don't often leave reviews for games but the bizarre, forced hate that this game has been receiving  makes me feel as if it is almost necessary, to combat all of the misinformation and downright lies that are being spread about this game for whatever reason. 

Although I have not finished the game as of yet, I feel confident in saying that this is easily one of the best Assassin's Creed games released thus far and, depending on how the story unfolds, has the potential to be the best. This game has improved on the previous entries in almost every way. Stealth is the main highlight in this regard, it was not hard to improve on the genuinely broken stealth mechanics of Valhalla but Shadows has gone above and beyond in making stealth the most fun it can be. Light and shadows matter and you will have to extinguish fires or otherwise make sure that your character is in the darkness to excel at stealth. You can now go prone to hide in tall grass or to find new ways around the environment, or to just make yourself a little harder to spot. Roofs are no longer safe, if you're standing out in the open on a roof, enemies will spot you. Seasons make sure that infiltrating a base is always going to be just a little different. There are tons of other small changes to these systems that provide innumerable benefits to the stealth system in this game but I think it is safe to say that this is probably the best stealth gameplay that exists outside of a dedicated stealth game like Dishonored or MGSV.

Combat is one of the areas where I feel like this is more of a sidestep than a step forward. There's nothing wrong with it and it's plenty of fun but its not breaking the mold in any way. It is a nice balance of the combat of the classic AC games and of the RPG games with crunchy impacts, fun weapons and movesets, and satisfying finishers.

The story is probably the biggest mystery to me as of now, both of the protagonists are interesting and the game opens on a very high note. My main problem so far comes from Ubisoft's obsession with non-linear storytelling. It does not serve the story and, in my opinion, harms it to a great degree. I would much rather just have a linear set of story missions where I am not picking which character to play as, leave all of the non-linearity to the side content. That being said, when the story does show its head it has always been great so far, Yasuke is a particular standout and I am very interested to learn more about his story. 

Suffice it to say, this game is absolutely beautiful and incredibly impressive for a massive open world RPG. It looks amazing, it runs well, the dynamic weather system is probably the best I have ever seen, the seasons change up the environment to keep it from looking samey, and so on. I know people try to pretend that graphics don't matter in games but they do and it is clear that an immense amount of work went into making this easily the best looking AC game, and probably the first game since Unity to have fidelity like this. 

I'm sure there's plenty more I could say but I think I've made my point, this is a fantastic game so far. Maybe once I finish I will update this review with further thoughts but I think I have played enough to know that most of my opinions aren't going to change, at least not to any substantial degree. If you like Assassin's Creed you will like this game. If this game looks fun to you, you will probably like it. Is it perfect? No, but the amount of reviews I have seen on steam of people picking apart every single thing that could possibly be a problem, or just straight up lying, in order to justify a negative review is ridiculous. It's OK to not like this game or even not like Ubisoft games as a whole, it's not OK to lie about a game because you are racist, sexist, or even just simply don't like it, in order to deceive people and to attempt to manipulate the public opinion about a game.",True,0,1,1742757450,76561198048507518,4289

It is still an Ubisot-Game, so the recipe hasnt changed this much, but in this case they did the storytelling a lot better then in Valhalla, imho. At least it doesnt feel this repetitive. 

You still have your chores, and without a heavy dose of Retalin you probably will be distracted by the lots of side-activities, which will also result in your character being a bit overpowered.

If you care about wokeness - the game is despite its violence a bit woke, but you can still decide at least if you want a same sex romance or not. What I dont get is the wildlife. You can paint it, but you cannot hunt it? PETA may like this, but I am responsible for a starving outpost lacking materials :-).

The setting is great and so are the graphics, I can run the game with 70fps on a RTX 3060 Laptop (6gb VRAM) on medium settings. I'd say it's pretty well optimized. The combat feels a little stiff sometimes with repeating animations, that's on of the only negatives. Also the controls are a bit weird in my opinion ([ALT] for dodging? [Q] for parrying?). The story is alright as far as I can say, nothing special, nothing bad. The game is challenging if your not overleveled and the open world itself feels alive. I'm really having fun with the game right now, although the 70$ price tag is pretty high, maybe wait for 50$ or so.

191014313,english,"Ima be real, a LOT of people dislike the game because of the unbelievable dumpsterfire of a marketing campaign from ubisofts side and i understand those people, it is a valid reason to not buy the game if you dont like the developer.
ubisoft shouldve done A LOT different from what they did.

Now to the game itself, i too was on the bandwagon of ""the game must be sh*t"" but i tried it anyways.
yasuke wouldnt even be a bad point for me (i really liked ""the ebony samurai"" who is yasuke in the nioh games).
So far im almost 16h in and only played naoe, her story and character seems quiet interesting, same for her playstyle.

The game runs INCREDIBLY smooth, especially compared to other modern games, as far as i can tell it (at least for me) runs even smoother than ghost of tsushima with permanent 70+ fps (ok in big crowded cities it can go down to 56+) with medion to high quality settings and a mid range PC.
I encountered only one bug so far which was a soundbug and was easily solved with changing 4 letters in the .ini file.
the story so far seems quiet interesting, similar to the other 3 AC games (namely origins, odyssey and valhalla).
the new combat with perfect parry and dodge and the difficulty of it feels engaging, as long as your not a god-gamer you shouldnt run head first into a castle with naoe since she gets pretty fast overwhelmed and is naturally a 2-3 hit (which suits her).
yes you can exploit the AI like some people ""meme"" about but honestly you can easily exploit EVERY AI in EVERY other game too, elden ring AI was so easily exploited that it wasnt even the slightest challange when your a ranged build player (except bosses but its not cuz of their sophisticated AI but because of the input reading which is basically cheating)

the changes to the stealth gameplay also seems very engaging, playing with light and shadow etc. and the game feels way less cluttered with small sidestuff like in odyssey which gives you more room to breath without getting overwhelmed by icons on the map.

overall i understand why people dont like the company or dont buy the game but when you objectivly judge the game, then at the end of the day it is a solid game and imo one of the better AC games since origins.",True,0,0,1742755243,76561198049538934,2152

A Truly Refreshing Surprise – Assassin’s Creed Is Back!
I honestly didn’t expect to enjoy Assassin’s Creed Shadows as much as I did, but wow — it completely blew me away. This is a serious step up from recent entries. The graphics are absolutely stunning, and the level of detail in the world design is next-level. What really caught me off guard, though, was the story — it’s far more engaging and emotionally grounded than Valhalla, Odyssey, or Origins.

Ubisoft really nailed the atmosphere and pacing here. The characters actually feel human again, and I found myself more invested in the narrative than I’ve been in years with this series. Combat is tight, stealth feels meaningful, and the setting is both fresh and immersive.

If you’ve felt burned out on AC in recent years, give Shadows a chance — you might be surprised, just like I was. This feels like the course correction the series desperately needed.

The Pros:
-Stealth is phenomenal 
-World is beautiful 
-Plenty of things to do
-Difficulty Tuning
-Less than 100hrs for story but can easily put over 50 and get your moneys worth
-Level scaling weapons is extremely cheap 
-Can be immersive (turn off UI and situationally open map). Lost track of time from just exploring
-Hideout feature is pretty cool

The Mid:
-Combat is okay, repetitive animations 
-Parkour is better than before, but not where it should be. Feels on rails and not very fluid at times. Parkour has been mid since Unity

The Bad:
-Voice acting is atrocious 
-Very point and shooty with game design, typical Ubi Open-World hand holding fest
-Narrative is nothing we haven't seen before
-0 interesting side characters
-Microtransactions in a single player game. Seriously?

A lot of cool elements along with the warring states connected to Templars, quite fitting, even more than the past 2 rpgs that came in. 
Combat feels good enough, tho Yasuke is indeed very strong.

1. Free parkour. Naoe not being able to free climb some of the shorter straight walls kinda sucks, but since they went all out on realistic climb limits, ill have to be okay with it.

The setting in feudal Japan is absolutely stunning. The graphics are amazing, and the world feels both familiar and fresh. The gameplay feels smooth and fun, and I'm digging the new stealth and parkour mechanics.

I'm also really enjoying the story of Yasuke. It's well-written and adds a really interesting new element to the Assassin's Creed universe.

Overall, Shadows feels like a good step forward for the series. It's a solid game that I'd definitely recommend to any fan of the franchise.

191001713,english,"Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is really good! It succeeds in delivering an impeccably crafted experience that seamlessly blends stunning visuals with a gripping narrative set against the backdrop of feudal Japan. The game’s graphic design is nothing short of breathtaking, with rich textures and vibrant hues that bring this era to life. With the serene countryside of feudal Japan, every scene feels meticulously detailed, creating an atmosphere that alternates between peaceful serenity and underlying tension. The fluidity of the combat animations adds another layer of polish, making each fight feel dynamic and engaging. Coupled with a stealth system that feels refined and intuitive, Shadows masterfully balances action and subtlety, allowing players to experience the game world in their own style.

One of the most compelling aspects of Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is its narrative, which is both well-crafted and acted. The game’s cutscenes are executed with precision, drawing players into a story filled with intrigue, betrayal, and redemption. Set in a Japan that appears at first glance to be a tranquil paradise, the game cleverly juxtaposes this idyllic veneer with the harsh realities of war and violence. This contrast not only enriches the world-building but also provides depth to the characters, making their struggles and motivations all the more relatable. The open-world design further enhances immersion, offering players a vast landscape to explore and interact with, from bustling markets to hidden temples.

In conclusion, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows succeeds in delivering a captivating experience that respects both the beauty and brutality of its setting. Its polished gameplay mechanics, coupled with a thoughtfully constructed narrative, make it a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike. The game’s ability to balance artistry with storytelling is a testament to the care and effort put into its development, solidifying its place as a standout entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise. Whether you’re immersed in the chaos of battle or lost in the tranquility of Japan’s countryside, Shadows offers an unforgettable journey through a world that feels both familiar and fresh.",True,0,3,1742746749,76561197969720758,740

If you enjoyed the previous AC games like Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, then you'll have a great time here because it's definitely in the same style as those previous iterations.

The world is GORGEOUS. I know that doesn't make or break a game in itself, but it has to be said just what a great job the artists did in bringing the world to life.

The combat feels like a proper evolution of the system from Valhalla, and you can pull of some really cool combos. I've seen some people say that raising the difficulty of the stealth and combat makes it more rewarding, and I can see that being true, although I personally didn't feel the need, and I certainly met my end multiple times on the regular difficulty when I though I could just power my way through several well-armed enemies.

I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll say I thought it was interesting and I was engaged throughout most of it, with a few hiccups here and there. Overall it was really good and if you are familiar with this time frame it's cool to pick out historical figures and events and go ""Hey I know that guy!""

I highly recommend trying it yourself before passing judgment. A lot of the criticisms people have are about things you can easily avoid or ignore:

 [*] Killing civilians and destroying shrines – Just don’t do it. Simple.
 [*] Gay Romance options – Pick the one you want or ignore them entirely. It’s always up to the player.
 [*] Microtransactions – Nobody is forcing you to buy anything. Most of it is cosmetic, so it doesn’t affect gameplay.
 [*] ""Disrespecting Japanese culture"" – This argument is ridiculous. Assassin’s Creed has leaned heavily into historical fiction for years, yet no one seems to care until now. Japanese media has been reinterpreting and playing around with Western history and culture for decades—just look at how anime depicts other cultures—but suddenly, when Ubisoft does it, it's a problem? Why are people outside the culture (JP culture) acting offended on their behalf? (I know about the issue with the shrines and civilians, and some stupid marketing ideas from ubisoft)
 [*] If you’re not a fan of Ubisoft’s open-world formula, that’s understandable—it’s not for everyone. But I actually really like how they handled it here. The game gives you a ton of flexibility, from full hand-holding to complete freedom to explore and discover things on your own.

I was hesitant to buy this at first because of various concerns, but I’m really glad I gave it a chance. The graphics are stunning, and the improvements are noticeable. Definitely worth trying for yourself.",True,0,1,1742745501,76561198071548023,2128

story-good
environment-decent
GAMEPLAY- it is smooth however it feels dull there is variety of weapons but idk what it is that the combat is like based there is one special move i seen it all the time would been nice if they had different special moves when fighting and the enemy attacks are repetitive but i do not mind it the boss fights are easy.

BAD BAD HUGE BIG L- the most terrible experience for me was when doing the story the guideance is not great they give you hints where to go and look but it is so annoying idk why they just do not make you go to the mission instead of searching for it maybe is cuz it is a assassin game so you suppose to do that but it is annoying when i have to figure out where to go there is a path finder where it leads to you're location but not where the main mission is unless you pin point where point is though guys is the missions on where to go is bad in my opinion i was trying so hard to do a main mission and wasted my time doing a mission that i am under level and was not aware till i was frustrated and found out i was not suppose to do this mission yet and  the explanation on how things work so that is my experience.

Getting caught and having to fight is also just exciting because if feels like a different experience every time.

 People comparing it to Ghost of Tsushima; they’re both amazing games, but they both have things to make them unique yes you can stealth in Tsushima but it focuses more on the fighting which i will say is a lot more complex than shadows. Shadows is obviously more focused on stealth but it does not lack in that department, feels like they’ve taken took the good parts of all the old games and made this beauty I’ve never felt like a total assassin till this game. but it also has yasuke which is the combat focused character although I’ve only played him in the beginning(i have 30hrs in this game and haven’t done any of the main missions) he feels like a powerhouse even on expert difficulty its not ghost of Tsushima combat but it’s still hella fun to slice people as him.

 Don’t listen to the negative comments this game will end up being one of the best ac games, i have no idea what the hate is for, feels so forced seems like people can’t enjoy something without complaining nowadays.

190997553,english,"I am 15 hours into AC Shadows but I am uninstalling cause when I read 3 chapters in a book last night I think it had better gameplay. 


Ghost of Tsushima is on steam, its the AC formula without as much bloat and the stupid animus shell story, buy that instead. 


Areas lack inspiration as one town feels the same as another, same as castles and temples. Even the death of Oda Nobunaga, an event I’ve seen in games at least 4 times before, was predictable in how they handled it in this story and possibly was the least memorable portrayal. 


What really broke the spell for me was clearing a castle area as the Samurai character Yasuke, whos actually plays very different from the shinobi character, he moves around like a tank and in so doing isnt as mobile. He could not reach the final chest I needed to complete the castle area and because I was in enemy territory I could not switch to the other character so that felt like a huge oversight. They added deliberate bloat with a base building minigame that’s half the loot, “knowledge points” which gate keep you from high level skills and the fact that nearly every Castle or side quest gives you legendary gear it makes all the gear not special, and everything below that tier worthless unless you have nothing else. 


Seasons and stealth are honestly an improvement from the previous titles and there are some good elements to this, but I can see that the item shops and progression systems are designed for players to spend extra money to have fun. Some fights with modern rock music were actually kinda fun, very Kill Bill, but that seemed to be the only soul of the game.",False,0,0,1742743899,76561198035857136,949

190997292,english,"Assassin’s Creed Shadows – The Return of Assassin’s Creed Greatness

After 13 hours with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I can confidently say this is the most exciting the series has felt since the legendary Ezio days. Ubisoft has delivered a stunningly immersive, feature-rich game that reignites the thrill of being an assassin—and then elevates it to a whole new level.

First off: the stealth and combat? Top-tier. Whether you’re ghosting through shadows or diving into a brutal showdown, the gameplay feels razor-sharp and endlessly satisfying. The weapon customization lets you fine-tune your tools of the trade for your own personal playstyle—quiet, deadly, chaotic, or all of the above.

But what really blew me away was the seasonal weather system. Rain can mask your movement, but then you’ve got to watch your step—those puddles will betray you. Snow isn’t just a pretty visual—it can give away your position if you’re not careful. Even walking near a cliff might send snow tumbling down, alerting guards below to your presence. These environmental effects make every infiltration a dynamic, unpredictable challenge.

Then there’s the brilliant dual protagonist system. Yasuke and Naoe are polar opposites in how they fight and approach missions. Yasuke brings raw power and head-on combat, while Naoe is all about precision, stealth, and agility. Switching between their playstyles feels fresh every time and adds serious depth to how you tackle each mission.

Exploration is rewarding in Shadows thanks to the knowledge-based progression system. Instead of just grinding XP, you’re encouraged to go out, explore, uncover secrets, and use that knowledge to unlock new moves and techniques. It’s a system that respects your time and curiosity, making every side mission and hidden scroll feel meaningful.

Also—can we talk about the grappling hook?! This thing changes the parkour game entirely. Scaling buildings, swinging across gaps, and pulling off stylish double-hook swings into a falcon dive haystack? Chef’s kiss. It makes movement not just functional, but fun.

And I haven’t even finished the main storyline yet. I’ve been too hooked on robbing castles, completing side quests, and building out my own base from scratch. Yes, you can custom-build your hideout, choose which buildings go where, and send scouts to gather intel on mission areas, giving you a strategic edge before you even step into danger.

All in all, Assassin’s Creed Shadows feels like a masterclass in open-world stealth-action. It combines thoughtful systems, deep customization, and fresh mechanics that make it more than just another AC game—it’s the one fans have been waiting for.

The Villages and Cities also look beautiful.

190991879,english,"Not a bad game nor a great game. Its just good, better than the recent fantasy/RPG games.
Pros:
- beautiful map with changing seasons
- AC games
- better stealth mechanics
- 90% you can play only with Naoe
- Music
- combat, types of weapons

Neutral:
- Story is average (basic John Wick revenge story). I guess after several AC games, they are unable to twist the Assassins v. templar stories even further.

Cons:
- exploration: Exhausting and also difficult, you have a horse, but the forests are too thick. And the map is huge, so most of the time, you have to go on foot...
- Yasuke, he doesn't fit into the environment at all. A big afro-american man speaking and reading japanese perfectly and destroying tiny japanese people. He's like better at everything than the japanese people. Forced DEI character. Luckely, you can avoid him 80% of the content. Still, he is a huge negative point.
- Unlocking skill trees. To unlock new skills, you have to unlock parts of the skill trees. To do that, you have to participate in side activites, but some of them are annoying. I hate ""kuji-kiri"" activites, when you have to play with an unskilled Naoe without hidden blade, pure torture. Additionaly, these side activities are around the map, some of them are deep in the woods and mountains (which is a real pain to explore). What a clever way to force exploring and side activities on the player.....
- Fast travel points: you can buy a few hideouts in larger cities, but most of you fast travel points are the top of the ENEMY base. A few times you have to fight your way out of the base. Not to mention the artifical rivers around the bases, you have to swim too.
- parkour is clunky compared to previous AC games. Naoe keeps getting stuck or glitching during movements.

Overall, I think is a good game to play with. Although I recommend the ""Immersive mode"" (I think japanese voice acting fits better to Naoe, the english counterpart or her is much deeper, does not fit for a young assissin)

Update: 
I changed my review from upvote to downvote because of the map and quest design. This game became a grand theft auto: AC & horse riding simulator. Map is simply huge, and the quests do not re-use existing places, majority of the gametime is riding. E.g. Katsuhime (3rd ally) quest chain. It was a 30 min quest where 25 min. was just riding. After 15 hours into the game, you'll end up burning out from. Most of the quest is just: ""travel 10 minutes to get there, you'll have a 30 sec. cutsence or kill someone within 5 minutes, and go to the next area and never comeback here. And because we have a 80km2 map, do this 9999x times."" Give you an actual example: ""A talk with a lady"" quest in Omi. I had to get from Azuchi to Goshiki outlands, needed 7,5 minutes riding (counted with a timer). Then, I had to watch a 2 minutes cutscene, then I was sent to almost back to Azuchi (but not excatly there). So my game was: pressed the ""w"" button for almost 8 minutes and watched my character riding, then watched 2 minutes cutscene, and another 4 minutes riding. But before you can continue the quest, you may want to spend another 10-15 minutes to unlock fast travel (although probably you may never have to come back here, usually all subzones just for 1 quest only..). In the end, you spent 30+ minutes and did absolutely nothing, no action, no gameplay. Most of the quests are designed in this way.
This is a mistake by game design, which could have been addressed in 5 ways:
1) all major fast travel points should have been available from the start (e.g. games with underground metro system being available from the start)
2) re-use existing locations / having longer quests in areas so you feel less exhausted from the constant traveling and having time to enjoy the given area (e.g. FF7 Rebirth, God of War Ragnarök, yakuza games)
3) for ""basic horse travel system"", should have been a smaller map (AC shadows 80 km2 in comparison: kingdom come 2 32 km2, Ghost of Thusima 29 km2, Horizon forbidden west 24 km2, spiderman 2 12km2)
4) make the damn map more accessible. From point A to point B, you want the shortes route, not the longest on-road route. But you can't have it due to the thick forests where you can't see sh*t and use your horse. A game can be still good looking without having 1 meter tall trees in every milimetre (Like in AC Valhalla, Ghost of thusima, Horizon Forbidden West, Kingdom come 2)
5) quest offers you to teleport to next questing area (in a question), saving time on pointless traveling. (ff7, ff16 games) Not talking about teleporting to a new zone, but...you know those quests when just ""go back and report to the quest giver who is now in another town, so you should spend another 10 minutes just riding your horse"" and making you basically an errand boy/girl .

Ubisoft promots itself as an ""experienced open world game developer"" and almost every game of the studio is an openworld game, yet this game design (or the lack of QoL imporvements) is (are) expected from a novice studio...

I know someone may argue that this is a minor issue, but after 20 hours, I still have half of the main targets (~6-7) to kill and feeling exhausted to play the game with the current traveling system, and the story is too generic to motivate me playing. Not to mention, that about 20 hrs, problably 10 is just traveling / 'mandatorily' exploring (otherwise you cant progress on your skill tree).

-there plenty of object u can cut thru with ur weapon and it accurate to the swing from ur character.
-the new engine they using ran a lot better compare to unreal engine 5 with ray tracing feature.


the bad:
-remove yasuke and u will get pretty much the same story with or without yasuke, because most of the story centre around Naoe, but i will check out the ending, heard it more or less the same issue.
- the horse is really basic, they had the same horse system for many years now and not a single improvement on it. like same animation and same movement.
-it get way too repetitive after few hours. 

will edit it again after finishing the game but so far, it average game, i mean it still fun for first few hours, but it will get dull aftrer that.

Things that make it an 8/10
World size
Good RPG system
Good Stealth system
Good combat 
Varied objectives
All the essentials of a ninja game are present

Things that I would like to see that would make this a 9/10 would be:

The ability to wait until night or control the time of day (most ninja games start missions at night)
The ability to jump onto your horse from a roof (might not be practical but it would be cool)
The ability for the horse to jump with the jump button (This should be standard now)
Proximity or detection vibration for controllers (Immersion)
improved auto wall hugging (I am a Tenchu fan, we love walls to hug)


For a 10/10 I would like to see:
Improved AI (a general improvement would be nice, they react to lights being extinguished but not to a door mysteriously opening) 
More interactive life outside of the towns (GoT did this well with different wildlife that tried to kill you)

190987690,english,"While Assassin’s Creed Shadows may not have the most groundbreaking story and isn’t without its flaws, it still offers a genuinely fun adventure through feudal Japan. The narrative, though occasionally on the boring side, serves as a backdrop for the real highlights: the immersive world and engaging gameplay. The combat, while satisfying and challenging at times, does suffer from somewhat lacking AI, so don’t expect truly epic battles or overly sophisticated enemy tactics. However, it still offers a good amount of variety and challenge for those who enjoy a more methodical approach to combat.

Stealth is another strong point, with players being able to navigate environments with careful precision. Although you can’t climb every surface as in some previous Assassin’s Creed titles, the climbing mechanics here feel more grounded and realistic, which actually adds to the overall immersion. It’s a minor limitation that doesn’t take away from the game’s enjoyment, but rather enhances the sense of realism in the environment.

As for the complaints surrounding microtransactions, yes, they’re a bit of a letdown, but they’ve been a part of Ubisoft’s games for years. It’s unfortunate, but at this point, it’s nothing new. The good news is, you absolutely don’t need to purchase them to enjoy the game. There are plenty of cool, unlockable armor sets and gear available through gameplay, so just ignore the microtransactions and enjoy what’s already there.

Regarding the Ubisoft login, it’s another element that’s been around for years. Yes, it’s a bit annoying, but it’s not a major issue. Simply sign in once and forget about it—it doesn’t impact your experience or gameplay in any significant way.

In the end, Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivers a fun, immersive journey through a richly detailed Japan. While it’s not perfect and has its share of drawbacks, it’s still a worthy experience for fans of the franchise and those craving a new take on the series’ formula.

Pros:
-Beautiful graphics and lighting. The environment is a huge step-up from previous titles.
-Naoe's gameplay is really solid. 
-Combat system is by far the best one yet among the RPG games.
-Naoe's weapons feel really really good.
-Stealth works.
-Interesting progression system.
-Good animations
-There are some interesting quests.
-Hideout building.

Cons:
-Writing is abysmal and one of the worst ones in the franchise. Apart from Naoe I literally can't remember any other characters' name.
-The main story is the same cliche, overused revenge story that we've seen hundreds of times, and a badly given one.
-The world is dead. Zero interactivity with the player whatsoever.
-While the faces are good, the cutscenes are just bad. 
-Exploration is non existant. Every town you enter feels the same and you just loot stuff for your hideout. That's it.
-Yasuke doesn't belong in this game, and I mean that gameplay-wise. Naoe should've been the only protagonist.

190979914,english,"At first I dont want to buy it in the first quarter when Ubisoft release the game. Every mess news out there are regarding the culture when you can kill people in temple and the gay shit romance agenda with Yasuke eventhough its an optional choice (These 2 are the big no no for me). I decided to buy the game to see with my own eyes for wtf is going on in the game and I like it so far. I have to admit the design city in this game is a top notch and to me AC Shadows >> Ghost of Tsushima city design and this is what Ubisoft always good at.

Here's my opinion so far:
1. The gameplay is good especially the fighting. This one beat AC Odyssey and Valhalla. There is a mechanic when you can call allies to join in your fight and this is cool.
2. How about parkour? Parkour in this game is trash. You cant side eject and there are so many things that I think they need to polish.
3. Stealth mechanic is great in this game or I'd say my faves stealth in AC series so far.
4. AI in this game has improved, I play it in expert difficulty and the AI will notice you in the upper ground but if its during night or under the shadow, they will hardly notice you.
5. They should make an option to automatically follow the pin point when riding from point A to point B.
6. The season change in this game is one of my faves so far and also, during the rain it will help you to do stealth mission because the enemy cannot hear your footstep which is a really good mechanic.

Overall, I already in 18,4 hours in the game and I love it so far.

The fights are recycled and the logic of how the opponents attack one after the other seems arbitrary.
The game is full, and I mean full of bugs.

When crossing a river, the horse will just randomly drop you. In addition, you feel completely cramped in many places during fights because there just wasn't that much space in the castles of feudal Japan. There is no good fighting atmosphere.

After 15 hours in, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is shaping up to be a solid entry in the series.

Pros:

Beautiful World: The environments are stunning, with incredible detail in the cities and immersive lighting/weather effects.

Stealth Mechanics: Parkour and stealth gameplay are on point, making sneaking around or silently taking down enemies super satisfying.

Story & Characters: A darker, more mature narrative that’s kept me engaged, with intriguing characters and moral dilemmas.

Exploration: The world is full of rewarding side content and collectibles that encourage exploration without feeling overwhelming.

Cons:

Bugs: I’ve encountered a few glitches with NPCs and animations, though nothing major.

Combat Feels Repetitive: Combat is fun but lacks the depth of older AC titles, often feeling like a repeat of the same moves.

Pacing Issues: There are some slower sections where the story drags a bit.

Microtransactions: They’re mostly cosmetic but still feel a little out of place.

Final Thoughts: It’s a great game overall, especially if you love stealth and exploration. A few bugs and repetitive combat hold it back, but it’s still worth playing for fans of the series. Excited to see how it improves with updates!",True,0,3,1742729282,76561199436691808,2394

190977326,english,"The game is fun for a casual gamer like me but I'm putting up this negative review because it seems I bought a demo instead of a full game considering that I cannot even get past a crucial point in the game (the possibility of switching to Yasuke) considering as soon as the cutscene ends on that particular quest (Eye for an Eye), the game crashes to desktop. At this moment there is no fix for the issue, no amount of toggling graphical options on or off or configuring settings work as a workaround, even making a new save and rushing through the missions will always end up the same as well. It has come to my attention that another quest (Stray Dogs) also suffers from the same CTD. But considering that a main mission, cannot be completed because of a CTD, I therefore cannot progress and hence locked out from technically a majority of the game in general.  It's also quite sad knowing this, after how many hours already I had put into the game. I hope Ubisoft fixes this ASAP and implements a hotfix for this, if this takes more than a week to resolve, I will be officially refunding the game. Shame though. Will update this review if the issue has been fixed and will give my full thoughts on this game later.

Edit: Finally found a workaround after 3 days! Thanks to @CallmeBeos on Reddit for the fix:

1.) Disable cloud save in Ubisoft Connect.
2.) Delete (with backup) all the old saves.
3.) Re-install the game on Steam.
4.) Start a new game and ONLY speed run with the story mission.

Overall I cannot recommend this game at its current state. I have deleted my saves worth over 30 hours at this point just so I could progress. What a definite waste of time. This review is subject to change after Ubisoft patches this game.",False,0,3,1742728222,76561198062665992,5502

cant wait to play it all week long yall

edit for first week.
i never really care how good or bad a game is, but ac is one of the game i grew up with
so, to whom it may concern, please read this.

1. the most important thing, why use microtrans for equip that has stats, just go with cosmetics and its obviously great
2. knowledge point system is really good, kinda feel like series of training for an assassin to be better. but level? mastery? forging stat? NOPE. just make it harder to achieve that knowledge and this would be fantastic
3. assasination is great but the way to achieves the overkill is just meh. tbh it would be better if just simply use unique gear spesifically to assasinate much stronger or condition-based assasination on each enemy rather than grinding for hours to compensate the health bar diff thru engraving. let me give an example, the black hood that comes with +2 assasinate in shadows, just make it a guaranted assasinate but only in the dark environment. and make it so much harder to get the gear, like a riddle to get through series of fortified barrier and/or only if you are undetected. and i can foresee the chain of mission to get through before completing each mission. this adds new kind of challenge, kinda like in brotherhood parkour high jump if i remember correctly
4. the sound stealth system is absolutely great, only for the ninja-like roof run and approaching enemy whilst sprinting, but how could i loot a wooden box silently and smashing bowl/teacup/lamp/any other furniture NEAR A FREAKIN SOLDIER IN A CLOSED ROOM without them noticing
5. romance feels weird, idk what to say, i just opted it out
6. in expert mode, the battle really amazing, how the daisho can 1 hit naoe, how he evade the smoke and slash thru the smoke, how their armor hard to break with a katana, but when their comrade falls, looking at their comrade dead body closely before clearing the zone and asking for reinforcement, or perhaps run to the nearest bell tower first (compare with blackflag and see the reaction on bell tower), for real tho, those guys are idiots. same goes to watcher that never turn his head nor position to make stealth even harder (they even sleep like a baby)
7. its better if the grappling hook can be used on a rock, or other kind of structure or maybe -pardon for my imagination- grappling on npc boats
8. is it just me, or the horse never walk backward
9. i dont like yasuke, i rather play as hattori hanzo for male character, please?
10. i like how indoor-outdoor sandal appearance, and how the rain make stealth even deadlier, but one small thing, if you get indoor soaked wet, why theres no trail to be traced in room full of lights, so maybe a little adjustment isnt gonna hurt

i have couple hundreds point more to write, but obviously i will continue playing this game and maybe just challenge myself in the head a little further, while waitin on improvement in the difficulty aspects or different mechanics
and btw, i dont like guaranteed assasinate, i wanna know the feel of failure, then dodging bullets and arrows trying to run away, those parkour and smoke bombs come in handy right?",True,0,0,1742722387,76561198081856670,5769

190970003,english,"Play in japanese. It's honestly better than I expected, best stealth in the series, and kind of reminds me of sc: Chaos theory where noise and light level were critical. In this Guards can hear you even crouched at full speed, and if close enough they will even hear the enviroment i.e compound alert bells landing on the ground, and destructable objects. Definitely expert for both felt the way to go, you die fairly quickly, especially early on, and it made stealth feel more incentive.

 While enemies feel spongy early on it feels much more reasonable when you progress just a little more while allowing you to enforce whatever challenge youd like with equipment, and while I didnt like combat at the beginning, I like it quite a bit now that if I do get caught I do actually like engaging In the combat and there are some combo potential between having two weapons now.

While i wish for even further hud customization hopefully soon, playing with minimal hud elements still felt the way to go especially removing health bars,  even with the fail assassination mechanic as the input will still display whether it will succeed and it's generally easy to tell which type of enemy you'd fail attempt anyways just by looking at them, I reccomend keeping it on, it adds to the stealth gameplay loop to me atleast and can change how you approach situations without feeling unfair and pointless. It genuinely feels well implemented here and fits naoe and seeing her skills develop as you progress. I am really surprised by that as I planned to turn it off but figured I'd give it a chance, I'm glad I did.

 I really don't have anything to say about yasuke, I didn't play this game for him but he seems fine as a inclusion for someone who wanted to try the series out I guess, kind of op though. Naoe feels overall more interesting and engaging to me and the game focuses primarily on her early on which I'm very happy about. Anyways, solid game depending on your values and im having a really fun time with it and it's pretty gorgeous with the new RTGI.",True,0,0,1742722186,76561198334348679,5863

190968938,english,"I do not often give reviews, out of laziness, but since this game has received plenty of backlash this past year, I wanted to participate in the whole ordeal.

While the game is a far cry from the first entries of the franchise, AC Shadows is better than AC Mirage, AC Valhalla or AC Odyssey, which seemed to not really know what they wanted to be. 
The stealth mechanics are definitely better than the recent games. The combat is not ground-breaking but overall pleasant.
Graphics are definitely not up-to-par compared to other big AAA games that have come out these past few years, though I am not particularly picky when it comes to graphics. 
I personally haven't experienced any bugs in the few hours I have played.
Being only at the beginning, I cannot fully judge the story but I would be lying if I said I was invested. As of now, the story seems mediocre. 

One of the major flaws of the game, is not the game itself but Ubisoft. While I am a proud Frenchman, I cannot condone the use of micro-transactions in a 70Eur game- and having to use a third-party app to play to game. 
While I had completely lost hope when it came to the AC franchise, Shadows has sparked a tiny bit of hope that perhaps Ubisoft might actually be able to put out great games in the future, like they used to. 

I do recommend the game, but not at this price. Do get it on sale.

190965308,english,"Assassin's Creed: Shadows is the best of the modern Assassin's creed games thanks to some needed improvements to the stealth, parkour and combat.

Visually the game is a real looker as well mainly due to the implementation of Ray tracing and a new weather system. This does mean that the game is pretty heavy to run but the optimisation is pretty good. My FPS is give or take 75 and despite not having any shader compilation when first starting the game, I've not had a single stutter or frame drop so far.

The only real negatives that I have with the game, is that cutscenes are locked to 31 FPS and that the English voice acting isn't great, which does detract from the story sadly.

Overall, if you’ve enjoyed previous entries in the series, this game is worth picking up. Just don’t expect anything revolutionary, for better or worse, it’s still very much an Assassin’s Creed game.

**Traversal/parkouring is bad**
There are games where you just hold a button and run forward, and the game will simply ""get"" your intention and ensure you parkour in cool ways.

This is NOT such a game.

Naoe will constantly stop at every obstacle, forcing you to press a button to get off it. More often then not turning around and climbing down rather then jumping off in the direction you want.
And when climbing towers, she will just go in the opposite direction that I want more often than not.

**Assassinating is off**
In Black Flag you could takeover a ship by hanging of the reeling. Not so mucn in this game.
It's as if they just removed some ways to assassinate.

**Synchronization points are off**
Towers that you climb to synchronize, are in many cases inside enemy territory.
And also without a way to do the leap of fate, forcing you to climb down.
They solved this by letting you buy apartments scattered over the map.
Still... it's a let down.

**Inventory management is bad**
Every time you move an item to stash, the game gives a confirmation for a second (feels like 10 seconds).
Highly annoying.

**Day/night cycle is bad**
You are expected do hide in the shadows.
But if you reach a target during the day there is no way to wait for nightfall.

Assassin's Creed and in extension Ubisoft games always have a certain way of operating.

I initially wanted to refund the game and my initial review was quite negative.
If it wasn't for the fact that my refund was denied the moment I requested it (Due to already having 4 hours on record at the time) I would not had continued playing the game.

I will mostly be naming the negatives.
Anything not mentioned such as Story, Soundtrack, Enviromental Design.
Could automatically be considered good or even great as I would like to spend my words naming what I do not like.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assassin's Creed Shadows starts both very strong and extremely weak.
The balancing is bad and the game is extremely poor at explaining some of it's fundamental and core gameplay mechanics.
Ubisoft games often are extremely hand holding which is also bad.
A well designed game would naturally and in it's early hours introduce all your gameplay options.
Shadows does not do this, Which is where a lot of my initial frustrations came from.

For example AC always has an option to scan enemies or spot them.
The last few games where with a birds eye view, The button for this was mapped to the d-pad by default for as far as I am aware.
Shadows's Naoe has the ability to scan enemies through walls (As opposed to Yasuke who has no such ability) The button for this has changed to Right stick click.

This likely due to the introduction of easily and readily accessible Tools and Abilities for both Characters without the need for a Weapon Wheel.
Initially I did not even know Naoe had this ability cus the game never told me.
Yet it is fundamental to her playstyle.
Having 'discovered' that ability on her not only made the game a lot easier, A whole lot more fun too.

The thing I have the biggest issue with is a game breaking bug and yet again something the game does not clearly state making it seem like a bug.
-The former being that Boats can get you stuck in a stationary position without the ability to move, You will have to reload your last save.
The latter being Servants roaming Temple and Castle grounds.
They are marked as Yellow by Eagle Eye.
Killing enough Servants will Desynchronize the Animus and you will have to reload your last save.
I swear it is actually bugged cus even when you don't touch any Servants in your newly reloaded save you may still Desynch.
The biggest problem is the game never specifies or otherwise clearly states that Servants are seen as Innocent Civillians, Neither does the Animus notify you of your transgressions if you do happen to Assassinate one or multiple.

For all Shadows faults it is starting to grow on me.
I think I will end up liking it more then Origins.",True,0,0,1742715256,76561198086758882,3725

The cutscenes are really long and take forever and run at 30 fps and dont look good at all. Not sure if there was a setting for the cutscenes alone, but my gameplay was doing 150 fps smoothly which is odd.

My biggest gripe is the crashing. Apparently if you mess with graphics setting (i think something with frame generation), the game will constantly crash when reopening the application. I found that this is an extremely common crash and you have to dumb down the settings significantly for it stop crashing.

For me, that was the deciding factor to get a refund. For a $70 triple A game, this shouldn't be a thing. I'll definitely re-buy it at a later time when Ubisoft fixes that crash and the game goes on sale.

The amount of detail in the characters, music, wild life, flora. EVERYTHING HAS A PLACE. Nothing feels like its just there. One important detail however.... this is NOT the game for you if you want a samurai hack and slash. if you want that, go play ghost or sekiro. If you want a well told story, with emotions and depth then this IS the game for you. This game heavily focuses on stealth for one character and brute power for the other. 

A couple of things: 
        1) Play the game with native languages enabled. Not everything translates perfectly, leaving some things to feel dry or without emotion. I highly recommend reading the subtitles in your own language, but leaving the characters to speak their native language.
       2) Install the game on an SSD. (pref a pci-e gen 4 or better is nice ngl) Just install this on the fastest drive you have. 
       3) Understand this game leans heavily into the RPG style AC games and not the older style. The leveling isn't as harsh as odyssey though. You can learn the dodging and parrying and take out things much higher level than yourself, there just isn't much of a reward for doing so as you cannot use the equipment until you match its level. This doesnt mean you cant assassinate tho. You can 1 shot most unarmored foes with the hidden blade ( yeah giant metal plates stop a tiny blade, crazy right?) 
      4) A PHENOMENAL movement system. Grappling hooks, diving, CRAWLING (why wasn't this always a thing) and the movements integration into combat are very very seamless.

190961186,english,"Quick PSA if you are reading this and it hasn't been patched: if you're missing DLSS options in upscaling and frame generation (in-game), try disabling Steam input for the controller - doing so has both fixed the issue for me, and enabled the Playstation controller UI. Yay!

I've only played a couple of hours, and the intro was a little underwhelming... but then I hit my first Thunderstorm. As teh kidz say - OMG. 

Running on a RTX4090+9800X3D+DLSS4 (Balanced) setup, this is a _stunning_ looking game. You just need to get your head past initial observations like, 'don't all Ubisoft-rendered leaves look the same?'... once the Devs start flexing their tech, you quickly stop comparing it to Ghost of Tsushima and start appreciating it as a work of art on its own merits.

I found the music a little too 70's cinema to being with, and the drop to 30fps cutscenes was jarring at first, but I found myself appreciating both after a short period of adjustment. If you really can't take the 30fps cutscenes try Lossless Scaling  - its adaptive FG tech works like a charm on pre-rendered stuff where input latency isn't a sticking point.

I'm still very early in, but I'm warming to/enjoying the combat mechanics. I even don't mind dying so much - often the enemy will say something nice like 'rest now, Shinobu.' Quite touched by the respect they pay given I was trying to murder them.

 If you're enabling Frame gen and noticing a little fizzle: it seems to vanish once you finish all the intro story stuff and set off into the open world proper.

I played the OG AC on xbox back in the day, and have followed/played the whole series on Xbox (and again on PC) with the exception of Mirage: I was completely burnt out after Valhalla. I honestly thought after Ghost of Tsushima, Ubisoft would not be able to compete. I am happy to see I was wrong.

I will say the horse riding animations/interactions still feel a little too animatronic compared to Red Dead 2, or GoT, or  Breath of the Wild/TotK... but allowing the player to enable auto-trotting/walking both when riding or walking? Where have you been all my life?

I love... _love_, the Shinobi's flips and acrobatic dismounts when traversing.

Very much looking forward to the continuing ninja adventures of Naoe. If Yatsuke is half as fun, it'll still be money well spent.

You have to compartmentalize those problems and focus on what you enjoy, because what's worth enjoying is done reasonably well and sometimes those things are done uniquely well (you can collect animals for your headquarters by petting them!) That's how it always is with Assassin's Creed (and Ubisoft games).  There just isn't a history-based-high-budget-stealth-and-action-adventure-rpg-lite quite like this.  And also: the world, RTGI lighting, textures, and weather systems are something to see. 

Some tips: Highly recommend playing with stealth and combat on Expert and guaranteed assassination kills off.  I forces you to take your time, plan your route, pay attention to your surroundings, use all the tools in your toolbelt, and plan who you're going to take out first before you attempt to take down the stronger enemies that don't go down in one hit.  It's not quite Hitman levels of strategy, but it makes the stealth-action stuff pop and the underlying stealth systems sing.

However I am about 16 hours in as far as gameplay and I can 100% tell you its not worth 70 dollars. The first 3 hours are cut scenes with about 30-45 mins of gameplay sprinkled in so be prepared for a movie unless you skip it. The voice acting and dialogue is absolutely atrocious unless you put it in full Japanese then its tolerable. The combat is okay, it feels a little clunky at times. The visuals are great but they also had the same stuff in RDR2 and that released a while ago. Now for the bad part... My save files somehow got corrupted mid gameplay and I didn't notice (partly my fault for not realizing) so I lost about 6 hours of gameplay and it sent me back to my 10 hour save point. Went from level 19 back to 13 and lost all the story progress. I quit out of the game, verified my files and now i cant even start the game up. Uninstalled, reinstalled, verified again. Still not able to start the game. Not worth the price point. Overall (even before the corrupted auto and manual saves) the game was a 5.5/10.

190957844,english,"AN HONEST REVIEW OF ASSASSINS CREED SHADOWS. (Played on Immersion mode) (NO SPOILERS)
I WILL BE MENTIONING ALL THE STUPID AND MEANINGLESS CRITICISM THIS GAME HAS RECEIVED FROM CONTENT CREATORS AT THE END. 

1. OVERALL: 8-9/10
Overall, Shadows is MUCH better than every previous Assassin's creed title since origins, in fact MILES better, I will be comparing it to the previous titles in terms of what has been changed, but of course as we all know the true competitor is Ghost Of Tsushima, a game that I’ve played twice on PS5 and Platted. This will be an Unbiased review solely based on the game itself.

2. GAMEPLAY:
During the majority of the game, Shadows mainly focuses on Naoe, she is the fastest, most agile and lethal Assassin to date and she also embodies the “Ninja/Shinobi” Archetype perfectly which I’ll explain why later. Shadows rewards accurate and planned out stealth gameplay with satisfying Assassinations, in previous titles you could run into a big fucking enemy base with Thor’s hammer or Hades’s Bident and easily fight large groups of enemies without pulling a sweat, or delete groups of enemies with explosive arrows and the Multi Target ability. In Shadows that’s practically impossible to do, the AI in this game HAVE been upgraded a TON, getting spotted by even 2 low level enemies on Normal difficulty will result in a very decent fight. You’ll have random bandits pulling combos on you and doing backflips off of your body, getting hit twice or thrice could get you killed or close to being killed, the AI is actually dangerous so as Naoe you truly have to plan out your approach, getting spotted requires you to truly lock in for the fight or just run away and hide. If you are someone that hates tanky enemies and wants to be rewarded for excellent stealth gameplay turn on guaranteed Assassinations in the settings. Shadows has much better controls that it’s predecessors, much smoother Combat and overall quality of life changes that improves the player’s experience in every way. Once such change is the follow button, no longer will you have to slow walk like an idiot to follow an NPC. 


3. CHARACTER FANTASY:
I would like to talk about Jin Sakai from Ghost first. In Ghost, Jin is known in the game as an almost supernatural figure. A Japanese Batman, in fact he plays a lot like Batman from the Arkham games, just with a Katana. With Jin you felt more powerful than enemy in the game-I’m willing to bet almost every GOT player slow walked up to an enemy camp with Jin, challenged the mongols to a duel, killed a few of them back to back and proceeded to wipe out the entire camp. Ghost of Tsushima leaned a lot into mythical and mysterious elements, some of the quests that rewarded legendary gear started out as tales being told by a guy playing an instrument. Jin himself felt like a supernatural entity building up his reputation as the game progressed and hunting down mongols. Here’s where Shadows differs, it feels more grounded to reality. Of course the main plot of the AC franchise is fantasy, but Shadows itself doesn’t exaggerate. Naoe as an Assassin has limits, she can’t do what Jin is fully capable off and that’s a GOOD thing. You aren’t a Japanese Batwoman, you need to plan out your Assassinations carefully and strategize before making any moves. You’ll be using the Eagle eye ability a lot before committing to a kill because getting spotted in a high risk area with difficult enemies could kill you very quickly. Naoe is the perfect Shinobi, she’s a nobody, doing what she does for a personal reason. You don’t build up some kind of reputation with her like Jin Sakai or Kassandra from Odyssey, she’s there just to get the job done. In and out and nobody’s the wiser. If you the player truly wanted to feel like a Shinobi then Naoe does an excellent job embodying this archetype.

3. MAP DESIGN, ENVIRONMENT AND ATMOSPHERE:
I’m fully serious when I say this, Shadows is by FAR the best looking game I’ve ever played, even better than games that could brick your PC on ultra high graphics, Ubi Quebec is known for great map and environment design and they’ve nailed it with this game, slow walking into the towns and cities feels so immersive and everything feels alive. The seasonal and weather system in this game is absolutely breathtaking, trust me you WILL take your time playing this game just to admire how beautiful it is in all seasons and my god..BLESS the developers who designed those wind effects, they look, sound and feel fantastic. Also another point, the game is completely polished and runs super well. I haven’t had a single bug OR issue so far and that has been one of the major complaints the gaming industry has received over the last few years with releases. Just a breathtaking and beautiful game overall and I haven’t even explored the entire map yet, Ubisoft have truly outdone themselves with the design in this game, everywhere you look there are details that just wow you. The lighting in this game is also the best I’ve seen in the industry so far. Again, absolutely breathtaking. If you as the player wanted to immerse yourself in game version of feudal Japan, Shadows got you covered and WILL exceed your expectations.

4. MAIN QUESTS AND SIDE OBJECTIVES:

BIG overhaul from previous titles, points of interests have been completely changed, clearly taken inspiration from Ghost but with an added twist on most of them, exploring the points of interest IS ACTUALLY REWARDING NOW, you will find yourself doing side quests a lot to farm up materials for your hideout (which is incredible) also completing castles rewards your time and patience with very nice loot instead of a fucking iron ingot (Valhalla 👎🏻) one of Naoe’s first quests involves infiltration and disguise, and the lead up to the target Assassination is very unique and intriguing, I haven’t skipped a single voice line so far. The game now rewards you for your time.

5. Game Criticism
At the end of the day this is a Ubi game so let’s discuss all the popular hate it has received.
A) Yasuke
If you are an individual who thinks politics shouldn’t be involved in games, then the character’s skin color shouldn’t matter to you at all. What matters is if the character is designed and written well, this is a fantasy genre after all. You aren’t playing a historically accurate game, this is a depiction on history with added fantasy elements in a fictional story. 
B) Romance options
Many complaints about this..”why is my Assassin involved romantically with a non binary individual??” because you chose to do so? In a ROLE PLAYING game? You idiot? You could’ve chose not to? Or play the game in canon mode? Pathetic hate from this
C) Voice acting and facial animation
Voice acting is kinda weak from NPC’s which is one of the game’s biggest drawbacks, then on immersion mode, the spoken Japanese is crisp and beautiful to listen to. Makes up for the occasionally weak animations
D) Microtransactions
It’s a ubi game of course it’ll have them, but why are people upset about this? Acting like they can’t finish the game without buying a skin from the store? You can literally ignore the ingame store and the battle pass and you’ll never have to look at them again, if you are a normal mature adult-this could just be ignored. If you’re a crybaby who gets mad that a pay to win option is available in a story game then seek help.

Finally, the game is fun. Stop basing your opinions from idiots online who have nothing better to do than to clip farm and ragebait for views. This game is worth the money and will impress you, take your time and enjoy it. Overall a big upgrade and a very good game from Ubisoft 👍🏼

Be it hate because of Ubisoft's track record, a black guy and a Japanese woman as protagonist, questionable romance parings, historical inaccuracies, is it woke or not (a lot of these things have been the case for A LOT of AC games) etc etc etc. 

Blah, blah blah... I just wanted to play a Japan themed Assassin's Creed game with a ninja/shinobi or samurai and have wanted to for years. After the first 3 hours... yes... about 3 hours... the game starts to open up and show you what it is. It's slow at first. I believe the devs cut out a lot of Yasuke at the beginning. It seems odd how it switches to Naoe abruptly and for a loooong time. I'm sure it will be all explained soon I'm just going to take my time and explore the world. I have been thoroughly enjoying it. Once I got the combat down of course. Runs great on my system. 4080 Super, 7800X3D, SSD. The best looking AC game ever bar none. Yes it looks better than Ghost of Tsushima too as well. Ghosts had better sword play though... that's UNDENIABLE  but I see the inspiration here.

190954503,english,"Let me preface with this: I just finished Act 1 and thoroughly enjoyed playing. The game is running surprisingly well around 120 fps. I have enjoyed the combat as well. I have had a ton of fun playing as the girl and the story has been interesting. The map is big with a lot to do and certainly keeps you busy in order to progress. I like how certain settings can be tweaked to tune the experience. The skills trees are something I want to grind to complete. 

But,

I cannot stand how all enemies scale to your character's leveling (unless they're stronger). It makes leveling completely pointless other than reaching new areas on the map. If you have harder areas on the map you have to get to, why not let me dominate the places I have surpassed and work towards the areas I haven't? Otherwise the game is completely the same, everywhere. Every castle is the same, every town feels the same, every enemy feels the same. I keep thinking this monotonous feeling that is creeping up will only get worse as the game continues. 

Now starting on what I assume is act 2, it seems like the entirety of the game could have done without Yasuke's character. Before you are able to switch to him and the game debuffs him for you, it was cool to mow through enemies. That is the only thing that makes sense about his character. Then you are able to use him and like magic, the shoguns' ""one man army"" can't mow through anybody. So now you have an AC character that can do the AC stuff, and another that makes no sense until maybe end game when he is completely leveled up? But wait! Almost forgot about the enemies level scaling! So the only use is to try some cool abilities you can't use on character 1 i guess. They could have had moments switching to him in missions to completely over power enemies or something but to be an actual main character just makes no sense to the game or AC in general. He can't climb a wall. LOL Love the idea of switching between the two, if the second character made any sense to the AC franchise. Maybe I'm jumping the gun on all of that, but it sure doesn't seem that way. 

In every other AC game I ALWAYS would have instances of jumping off a building by accident, jumping to my death, etc. but luckily Ubisoft has fixed that with grapple hooks. Some walls that should be completely scale-able based on literally any other AC game are not possible, you are forced to swing from a grapple instead. Use your grapple hook to go up a story. Why? This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't in EVERY SINGLE GAME from AC. 

There are several QOL errors that should be known before releasing, but, ya know, micro transactions are important. 

I recommend the game, but way later when it is on sale, if you have $70 you don't care about, or if you don't care about the little details. I'll probably play it for another 20-40 hours and never play it again, however long it takes to finish the story. This is not a game you play twice or for long after you've finished the story IMO.",True,0,2,1742704389,76561199367014653,1787
190954446,english,"At the time of this review I am 11.4 hours in and I have been enjoying it. I enjoy the stealth and the combat feels pretty smooth. Its not as RPG as the past few games but I still like it. The only AC games I have played in the past are odyssey and Syndicate so take that as you will.
For those of you that want to understand some complaints about the micro-transactions I will tell you how they are implemented. Yes, there are different packs for your character, allies, and mount however this is not new at all and they have had these same types of micro-transactions in as early as I have seen in syndicate. I don't understand the problem with this as its all up to those who want to buy it; the packs aren't going to make or break the game so it shouldn't matter since they aren't forcing you to buy them. Another complaint is with the ""battle pass"" which people will lie and say you have to pay for it. No you don't have to pay for it. It is free and you will complete it by just playing through the game so if someone tries to tell you otherwise they are lying.
Ultimately I think this game is a solid 7.5/8 out of 10. It has been enjoyable so far and I look forward to continuing the story and being able to play as Yasuke for a bit. The beginning can be slow though but when you get out of the prologue it picks up. Also the weather and season systems is a cool touch that can change how the stealth works.

K so Im about 15 hours in and so far?

Been pretty good,

Gameplay is great, environments look amazing, game runs surprisingly well despite my terrible CPU (Ryzen 7 2700x), and I've been playing on my Steam Deck OLED too where the game is also decent.

Ive seen people saying the story's bad but so far Im liking it more than Odyssey or Valhalla's,

Main problems are the english VA is as bad as everyone's saying, a friend of mine said it sounds like you're playing a Kung Pow! Enter The Fist game lmao, 

You can turn Immersive Mode on so that Japanese characters speak Japanese and Portuguese NPCs will speak Portuguese, better that way.

Other than that while the environments look gorgeous, the character models are pretty bad,

The combat feels repetitive at first but as you start upgrading your skill trees it gets much better.

Not that far in still but gonna give it an 8/10 so far, pretty damn good,

Will change review accordingly if my thoughts change.

The game is visually stunning, like legitimately f@#king gorgeous. It's fun to play, combat is basic but satisfying, exploration is easily encouraged simply because of how gorgeous the game world is to look at. 

This joins other titles like RDR2 and Cyberpunk where it's a pleasure to just walk slowly thru the environments soaking them in.

The game is extremely demanding, but the visuals offered back justify those demands placed on your rig. 

Importantly, it runs extremely smooth, traversal stutter and compilation stutter etc often associated with UE4/5 titles is non existent here. This iteration of the Anvil engine is very impressive stuff.

If you enjoy Assassin's Creed you'll love this. If you are someone like me who DID enjoy them, but then when you got to Valhalla you got burnt out because of how bloated and boring that title was, maybe you will also enjoy this.

If you are judging it against Ghost of Tsushima: They are different enough from each-other where the comparisons really don't make for a productive critique...but no arguing the writing and english VO work in GoT is superior.  But that doesn't make AC Shadows a lesser game overall by any means. AC Shadows is RPG-AC and GoT is GoT.

- One of the best looking games I have played, period. Definitely the best looking environments for Assassin's Creed yet.

- Grappling Hook is cool.

- I am starting to really like the combat. It takes getting used to, but it feels different from previous AC games.

- Deals with Multi-Monitor Ultrawide very well. I am running it in 7680X1440 and it is absolutely, jaw-droppingly gorgeous. - But WTF not making cut-scenes sans black-bars and capping them at 30 FPS? I definitely recommend getting ""Lossless Scaling"" steam app for the cut-scenes. They flow much better at 60FPS. 

- Good FSR Implementation! I have a mid-range card and with ultrawide enabled I am getting 100+FPS (Frame Gen + Lossless Scaling); is it cheating? I don't care: it looks good and runs smooth as butter.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- [b]The start is a chore[/b] -  For the first few hours it feels like there are 3 hours of cut-scenes with about 15 minutes of gameplay mixed-in. The English VO makes it feel like it drags, and drags, and drags...which brings me to:

- [b]The English dub is not good for the main character and some of the NPCs.[/b] - The single-biggest recommendation I have to improve the game is to use the Japanese voice with English subtitles. The Japanese VOs are great as far as I can tell. The English dub just sounds very monotone and at times almost sounding like AI or just being read from a cue-card for the first time. The Japanese dub has much more emotion in the delivery and it definitely makes a difference.

- [b]The story jumping back-and-forth in time is a bit annoying.[/b]  Like it is not bad enough I get my ass beat twice in cut-scenes...but now the skills I have acquired disappear for 20 minutes so I can flash-back-in-time to before I acquired them...annoying.

- [b]This game commits the cardinal sin of defeating you in the cutscenes...TWICE![/b] Achieve the goal; have the goal taken from you and get beat up in a cut-scene...40 minutes later: Achieve the goal; have the goal taken from you and get beat up in a cut-scene. Then sit through what feels like an eternity of cut-scenes to FINALLY start the game-play. Once the gameplay starts though, it is great.

-[b]Can we be done with this whole Animus thing?[/b] - It was a novel idea for a couple of the games; but at some point, I think most of us stopped caring, and the whole Animus thing just becomes annoying interruptions in the immersion to remind you that you're playing a simulation and that the REAL story takes place in blah, blah so you can get the McGuffin that meh, meh, mehs all the way to I don't give a rat's ass.
Just make a game that takes place in a fictionalized version of history...throw in some Mythology. That's it...nothing to do with simulations, corporations, etc. It is annoying at this point.

- [b]Cut-Scenes & Photo Mode[/b] - They made the game-play great for ultra-widescreen - but the cut-scenes and the photo-mode are still in 16:9.

- [b]BUGS![/b] - I have had a couple crashes 
              - the music keeps shutting off while playing. 
              - Texture loading issues
              - flashy backgrounds with Frame Generation.

- Could use some optimization

- The climbing in nature is frustrating...lots of sliding down hills. In some places I had flashbacks of climbing up the back-face of the Throat of the World in Skyrim.

I will be the first to say this rpg stage is not by any means a good thing to endure anymore, I can truthfully say from an unbiased stand point that this game is a step in the right direction and 2 steps in the wrong direction. 

The combat is still the same spongy rpg shit but nonetheless its the fun, the stealth is where this game excels they took what the did right in mirage and built on it like they should have done from the beginning of the rpg phase of this franchise, the game is not a complete pile like the previous 3 games in the franchise it has some remnants of the old games in that much is visible.

The game is not worth 70 dollars but its worth the time playing when you finish clearing out a hideout you feel rewarded you felt how you did after finishing a fort in black flag or finishing some of the assassination missions in 2 Brotherhood or Revelations, but the combat does not compare to what those games were but you can not compare a camel to a cow.

instead what i got was a game that while not perfect is ridiculously fun, fine tuned and beautiful in its presentation.

Shadows is truly a step up in terms of the RPG style AC games and is the first one of its kind that actually makes me understand the vision they had with origins all those years ago.

Combat is fluid, versatile and flashy in a way it has never been before. this game has arguably some of the best kill/execution animations of the entire franchise.

Stealth has been expanded massively not just in terms of the ability to prone but lots of new environmental interactions, large skill trees with varied skill that really feel impactful on how you approach combat and stealth. (you can actually assassinate people again!!!)

Parkour has been even further expanded upon with a tonne of new interactions with terrain. you can front flip off a cliff. enough said.

The voice acting in immersive mode is phenomenal and the cinematography makes the cutscenes far more dynamic than previous games

Story is enjoyable, obviously thematically very similar to previous entries but not done badly whatsoever.

190947915,english,"Overall it's a pretty solid game, but I definitely have some gripes with it. 

Combat feels good and tight, but level scaling totally ruins the progression and power fantasy. If I want to grind and be OP, I should be allowed to. Once you get into the 20's the decent enemies just feel like boring damage sponges.

I'm sure its difficult to implement or whatever. but I really think this game would be 10x better if you could hot swap between characters, getting sucked into combat as Naoe can be very punishing (which is fine), but if the two main characters are always together I don't really see why it wasn't implemented. Huge swing and a miss.

A lot of the voice acting is weak, Naoe being a big one. The story is pretty meh for 10-12 hours which is asking a lot to get people committed.

I haven't been to every region, but they all feel extremely similar. I'm aware its based on a real location, but they don't have unique gimmicks or anything. In addition to this an immense amount of the open world is borderline non traversable, which is fine, but should be known. 

The hideout is cool, the massive amount of targets is awesome, albeit a bit overwhelming at times.

I know that seems pretty negative, but the game is good and I have fun playing it, which is what matters most. It does feel like Ubisoft took some steps in the right direction, but Ghost of Tsushima is absolutely still the pinnacle of open world games set in Japan.",True,0,0,1742697267,76561198015096192,2086

190946629,english,"I hate Assassin's Creed games. The animus overlay crap has totally killed immersion for decades. But I watched someone play it and it actually looked pretty good. So I gave it a shot. It's pretty good.

The story presentation is excellent. I switched to japanese voices because the english ones were terrible, especially for Naoe. I think maybe they got native japanese speakers and had them speak english. It doesn't work. Yasuke's VA is great. So is Nobunaga. But Naoe is just god awful and she talks all the time so I had to switch. 

Compositions during cutscenes are great. It's one of the few cutscene heavy games I don't despise sitting through. It's on the quality of a decent film. I think Yasuke is pretty badass and sympathetic. He's a man lost in the world, looked as an outsider, enslaved and belittled, then Nobunaga sees something in him. It's resonant. I don't care about the controversy before it came out. He works as a character in this story quite well. 

Combat is kinda flimsy. Sometimes it feels alright, sometimes it feels like paper swords. 

Visually it's great, could be better. They put a filter over it that kills the dynamic range of colors. Could have done without that. Might try a graphics mod to see if I can get it closer to naturalistic. 

The stealth is decent. It could be better. It also has a flimsy feel to it. Something is missing to make it pop. 

Parkour is great and obnoxious. Running up random trees on accident is just stupid. It's sticky. You'll be aimed one way but still hit the tree to your left because it over-assumed. But when it's working correctly it's really good. 

Anyway, I am pleasantly impressed. A better than I thought. And honestly, I never would have tried it without the hoopla surrounding it because I would have ignored it like every other AC game.",True,0,4,1742695961,76561197972564142,3372

DLSS 4 Performance and Preset K, by default the game ships with the latest DLSS but does NOT use Preset K but instead E so you will want to manually override this.

Frame gen works fine, over 100fps with it on with no adverse latency.

I do not find the graphics overly impressive even with Ultra High,

Anyway I found the swordplay fun for 5 mins then it became repetitive button mashing, parry, dodge, attack, got boring real quick I found. The parkouring also somehow feels disjointed in a way.

And what's with all the lengthy cutscenes locked in 21:9 and 30fps!

No stuttering or anything during gameplay though which was nice to see I guess, 1 step forwards, 2 steps back as they say.

Honestly, the story writing in Assassin's Creed: Shadow is completely clueless. By the time I finished the game, it made me want to refund it.

The quests are painfully repetitive and dull. Almost every mission follows the same tedious formula:
1. Find Person A and engage in a dialogue with meaningless dialogue choices.
2. Travel to Location A, eliminate enemies via stealth or direct combat.
3. Locate Person B, engage in another set of meaningless dialogue choices.
4. Go to Location B, once again eliminate numerous enemies through stealth or combat to retrieve an item.
5. Return to Person B to confirm you're ""ready.""
6. Travel to the final location and repeat the cycle of stealth or combat to assassinate your target.

Additionally, the inclusion of microtransactions in a single-player game is intrusive, unnecessary, and greedy. All towns and cities feel lifeless and empty. Character facial expressions during cutscenes are stiff and unnatural.

Perhaps the good things about this game are the graphics and decent combat mechanics, but even these positives are marred by poor optimization. Lmao.

I only play single player games that have competent writing. This game fails in that respect. The leadership behind this title clearly failed and failed spectacularly.

You see snow literally melt away as Winter turns to Spring. Leaves also change colour on trees when Fall comes rolling through. These subtle touches show a real attention to detail as well as add immersion to AC Shadows.  

The animations and fluidity of the combat is top notch. You can feel the difference between the two playable characters. Yasuke is a hulking mountain who literally turns enemies into an explosion of viscera and brain matter. Naoe is a lithe assassin who feels fast and light on her feet. You feel a difference between weapons and as you unlock more skills, you feel your toolkit becoming bigger but not overweighted.

There is two battle passes, daily quests, premium currency pickups on open world, ads for in-game store and ads for other game in the series. Thats awful.

Bugs are suprisingly scarce. Sometimes NPCs stop working and just get their ass beaten by you. BGM dies every 2-3 hours so you have to restart the game. Servicable.

Graphics are fire, optimization is fine -- 4070 + 5600 works just fine, no drops, but cutscenes are 30 fps for some reason.

Gameplay is good, but only if you play the protag. There's option to play Yasuke and smash everything, but i've played him grand total of 10 minutes in forced sequences, other than that you can play assasins creed instead of some crappy slasher. Sadly he's busted, because while Naoe does no damage, he just breaks faces and posture like nothing. His stealth options are limited, movement is very clunky and its straight up no fun trying to control him. Maybe fixable to make it more fluid in future patches, but for now its a horrid pain to play Yasuke.

Having small circles of enemies from different groups vs huge cult that you have to figure out one by one is not as fun, but still works. Fun targets are fun, like finding local psychos who everyone mistakes for yokai.

Story is eh. It kinda works. Not that im super intrigued by any part of it.

Picking it up at full price (9790 JPY for me) seems like a bad move. For 20$, considering how much they bet on mtx to make money off it, could be useable. In case you're tempted to buy some stuff from store, just get yourself some trainer, but you're drowning in money and resources anyway so not sure whats the point of that.

190940563,english,"I was a certified hater of this game long before it came out. I figured I would at least give it a shot because the combat looked not horrible, and all the stealth mechanics are lifted from Splinter Cell so if Ubisoft goes bankrupt (please it would be so funny) this is probably the closest thing I'll get to a new Splinter Cell. After playing it for a few hours, I can safely say that it's yet another standard Ubisoft 6/10. Combat is ok at best. Stealth is definitely watered down SC, so it's ok I guess, though I don't like the fact that they're trying to market things from 20-30 year old games like the ability to crawl as some big revolutionary idea. I don't like the weird gay stuff and I think someone like Yasuke probably should have just been an npc so the game could focus completely on Naoe, especially considering it switches to her perspective after like 20 minutes and you don't play as Yasuke again for another 10 hours, or so I've heard. I don't care that the Japan game has a black guy but it's clearly just for diversity points because it's Ubisoft, of course it is. Ubisoft has consistently been the ""playing it safe"" company since 2013. Just look at the last 20 operators they've added to R6, they're all gay or trans or toasters for no reason other than ""hey look what we did"" when that game doesn't even have a campaign or a story that anybody actually pays attention to. Also, the game runs like steaming dog shit on my rig, which isn't exactly top of the line but I know for a fact I should be able to run this game no problem based on the recommended system requirements. Call me a boomer but I think we're still a few years off still from having forced ray tracing be a standard, especially when every developer now is relying on framegen and ai upscaling instead of actually optimizing their game. On the rare occasions I turn ray tracing on in a game, I expect it to look good, if I have to lower all my settings to run it with ray tracing that kind of defeats the point of it. So while I don't think this game is overtly horrible, I don't think it's worth $70. I think it's stupid that a singleplayer game is online only, and the fact that it has microtransactions in the form of credits and Call of Duty style cosmetic bundles is pretty insulting. I would wait for a heavy sale or better yet, just go play Ghost of Tsushima. Go play literally any other stealth game or Japanese game. The Splinter Cell games are still great, MGS is still great. Dishonored is still great. Any of these options will be much more enjoyable than Ubislop any day of the week.",True,0,0,1742689363,76561198120422398,358

190940168,english,"Pretty similar to every other AC game. Same game with new paint. When you fight, each weapon has exactly 2 animations. You see the same 2 animations over and over and over and over and over again. Basic style of revenge story. I literally said out loud that Mitsuhide was the bad guy. I was right. I feel like anyone with some basic knowledge would know that you can't kill the top bad guy in a game in the first few missions. I don't understand the point of even adding that portion when literally nothing changes, the enemies are the same, they're just wearing black armor instead of red armor (Oooohhh fancy). 

Been having a bit of fun with the game but it's nothing special and especially not worth $70. Wait until it's on sale and it'll probably be worth it. Same story over and over again. Get mission, kill this one guy, take his thing, come back, get another mission. 

I also think that Yasuke is a completely and utterly useless portion of the game. You play as him for 5 minutes at the beginning, then you don't see him again for 5-6 hours of gameplay, then you come across him and can play as him. At that point you've already spent hours leveling up Naoe and don't want to swap to him. It would make more sense if Yasuke was a DLC character or something because he's entirely useless. Pretty lame attempt at wokeness or something. We can't just add a random black guy into ancient Japan because he's a random black guy. Kinda ruins the game because his storyline just adds a whole random part of the game that literally means nothing. Also, the Japanese literally didn't have black people there until the 17th century and this game is based in 1581. The Japanese never would've allowed black people to become Samurai, they didn't even allow left handed people to become Samurai. What is the point? 

I'm understanding why the Japanese Prime Minister is upset, pretty lame representation of this time in Japan. I'd be upset too if it were a game based on your country and half of the characters aren't even from your country AND, at that, kills and destroys your entire country and history. Also, how can literally every single person in Japan be an old man with a mustache and goatee that used to be the greatest warrior alive back in his day. 

Been a bit buggy too. When you try to summon the horse, he just randomly stops following you but sometimes, you're standing still and he just races by, you grab him and are going full speed. The assassination button is also a bit messed up. Sometimes it literally just doesn't appear and you're standing on a roof in the darkness walking circles trying to get it to pop up. 

Also, I was an hour and a half in when the massive cut scenes were finally done. You spend a majority of the first portion of the game watching cutscenes with characters who have badly synced mouths and hands that look unanimated, sometimes just teleporting and moving robotically. Sometimes you have to read the name over the subtitles to figure out which person is the one talking. The artwork is kinda cool though but weird looking at close. 

A lot of people are complaining about performance issues but I haven't had any problems. (I have a 4070, i9-13900F, 32gb RAM, etc.) I have noticed a ton of loading screens. Even if you're fast travelling 50 feet, there is a 15 second loading screen.  Also, the artwork that Junjiro shows you and the ones you make are extremely pixelated when it zooms in on it, even on full graphics. Looks like pixel art when you just spent 5 minutes working to get your character to paint it with a brush. Very cool looking art, but extremely pixelated at close. No point in adding an entire portion to the game about artwork and how to make it look good when it doesn't look good and doesn't look like you made it. 

The micro transactions are everywhere. Currently trying to take on the Twisted Tree as Naoe, I barely survived fighting first guy because I got bum rushed and jumped by 15 guys no matter how stealthy you are, as soon as you stab him, it's game on. AND, at that, as soon as you kill him, FIVE MORE show up that are all equally, if not stronger than him. You literally have no choice but to run away and hopefully be able to stab one of them and peck him to death over and over. Then you have 4 more to do that to. Starting to feel like I need to pay to get better stuff to beat this section. Any game that makes me feel like I need to pay to be able to beat a section reeks of fishiness to me. 

TL:DR: it's okay, not worth $70, added random black guy with no story importance for being woke and crams microtransactions down your throat. Typical Ubisoft copy and paste game with new paint. Still a little fun because you have a Katana.",False,0,2,1742688943,76561198195742425,946

It's a pretty looking game with no substance inside of it.
I will probably play some more of it just to kill some time whilst watching/listening to something in the background.

The fact that i have relegated a ""single player story driven game"" to ""guess i will listen to a podcast on the side"" should speak volumes of my opinion of the game, how repetitive it is, and how boring the writing is.

Also, why the f*ck are enemy levels a thing in this game?
Why is a common soldier all of a sudden immortal just because he has a higher number?
why do i go from tanking ~3/4 hits to dying in 1 shot, when all that happened was that the number next to the enemy went up by one?
Why do i have to run around doing chores to make sure my steel blade actually hurts the enemy?

Remember, this costs 70$ and some will have payed more:

Why is there a battle pass in a single player game?
Why is there a premium currency you need to buy with real money?
Why is there a FOMO rotating shop of item's?
Why do they sell an option to reveal the map for real money?
Why can you buy in game currency with real money?

Why are there 4 ""Premium"" armor sets you can only get by spending real money?
4 armor sets witch could have for example been given to the player for let's say completing some really challenging achievements.
But no, they have to squeeze every penny out of us while they still can.

By the way, they're not selling skins, they are selling items with their own stats.

10 hours in and i havent found anything i can geniunly say is good apart from the graphic everything is bad to okay but never good. 
Skillsystem is a joke since alot of skills are simply deal 2% more dmg with katanas or at night while others become completly pointless when you play with instakill assasinations since they just boost assassination dmg for healtbars.
Music is kinda weird i was playing an mission where an fight started and suddenly some wanky music started playing that totally killed the mood and ruined the moment.
UI is terrible with notifications popping up dead center in your screen mid combat blocking a huge chunk of your vision.
I cant  really tell anything about the story or charackters since the few missions i have done so far felt more like side missions which although werent bad also didnt really amaze me while the chacrachters besides naoe 10 hours in barely exist.

Overall i cant recommend the game to anyone for the full price maybe at 50% of it might be a decent deal better at 75% of. anyone who wants to play an amazing stealth/assasin game should consider ghost of tsushima or even rise of the ronin",False,0,0,1742688461,76561198042029355,698

Possibly the worst parkour system in the series, I wasn't expecting much, but it's just frustrating when it behaves inconsistently. Parkour down will sometimes launch Naoe to the ground, causing damage, when there is a perfectly good platform to land on at a reasonable distance.

But this yasuke shouldn't even exist, we need a japanese protagonist. When this game's trailer first came out it was called ac codename red and takes place in Japan, I was super excited since the previous big ac game was AC Valhalla which was released in 2020(mirage is sooo expensive compare to its quality and length of the game). When I was playing the myth trilogy, I always had the idea I still have it today which is why do they have all kinds of different cons in the game, can't ubisoft just put all the pros that players were complimenting about and put them into the one game? How is this even hard? Yet in Shadows I could still see some improvements but however, considering the time used and the price and the overall quality of this game, I can only rate this game a 5/10, which is a big failure for a big company like Ubisoft, they had so many chances to do better, but they chose to not to.

The story is solid so far, not the best not the worst, but some added touches like the hideout builder make it feel fresh. The world is absolutely beautiful and the movement mechanics, while far from perfect, are a big step in a positive direction from previous games.

First wait until the game goes half price on this or Epic's platform and second, wait for the release of some mods that could  mitigate the planned and monetised inconveniences .

Here are some pros: 

1- The landscape is beautiful and the graphics are excellent. 
2- The size of the map is enormous and you can spend a few hours just exploring. 
3- The artwork for the armours is well done. Although some models are said to be a bit inaccurate for the time period, they still look nice. 


The cons: 

1- A very, VERY predatory monetisation system. In fact you will find the Store before you can find the Settings menu. Also, Mugthief has a released a great YT video on this subject. 
2- Terrible English voice acting for some characters.
3- A bland and janky combat system. 
4- That stupid Ubisoft launcher. Why do they need this??????? You pay 90.00 for a single player game and yet you still have to create an account?
5- The music....it's horrible. The ambiance music is ok but that modern rockabilly music playing during some fight scenes is just God awful. There is also the trap music but I have not reached that part yet. 
6- The annoying chronological cuts...I think there are so many that they would even make Tarantino's head spin.  It wouldn't surprise me if the creative team was over-inspired by Samurai Cinema and Kill-Bill. There was nothing original about the whole layout. 
7- The prologue was boring and long. CP 2077 had something similar but we at least got into the action right away. 

I really loved Ubisoft and the AC franchise and I decided to try this game to at least give it a fair chance. I will play until the end to see how the story ends and then I will uninstall.",False,0,1,1742681164,76561198032332338,5273

The game has a damn beautiful environment, the Japanese are really well done. The combat system is also very good, it's something new again, but you can get used to it pretty quickly. It's a huge improvement from Valhalla because Valhalla was shit in terms of the open world system and story. Assassin's Creed Shadows sucked me in for 7 hours and I know now that it's one of those games that I'll finish 100% because it's incredibly fun.

+ It's well optimized on the day of release, so on my RTX 3060 and Ryzen 5 2600 setup I didn't have a single problem on high details
+ It has incredibly fast loading times compared to Valhalla or Oddysey, for example
/- The price is already normal these days, 70 euros is the price of bigger triple A games, and if someone has a problem with it, that's their business.
+ Naoe the main character has a great voice acting in both English and Japanese and plus she is incredibly hot XD
+ The map is quite big so there is a lot to do

+/- Level scaling is something that has been carried over from the Origin and here it is not such a problem even though it may still bother some people for some reason...

And as for the depiction of the Japanese environment, I think Ubisoft put a lot of work into it and they did it very nicely.

190929483,english,"Assassin's Creed Shadows is a visual masterpiece that captures the essence of feudal Japan with breathtaking detail. The lush landscapes, intricate architecture, and dynamic weather effects create an immersive experience that is truly captivating. Initially, I approached the game with some reservations due to the surrounding controversies, which had tempered my expectations. However, upon playing, I was pleasantly surprised by the game's quality and depth. This unexpected delight made my journey through its world all the more rewarding—at first.

The Japan setting is truly something special, with environments that feel alive and beautifully realized. The combat is fun and responsive, and I enjoyed how item progression allows for engaging build variety. Unlocking better and better epic gear gave a real sense of progression and experimentation, which added a satisfying layer to the gameplay loop.

Unfortunately, the storytelling doesn’t quite match the strength of the game's visuals or mechanics. While the characters are somewhat likable, their stories are shallow and lack the emotional weight or complexity to keep me invested. As I progressed, I found myself caring less about the narrative and more about just getting through it. I did finish the main story and the prologue, but the experience left me too bored to push for 100% completion.

In the end, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers a beautiful world with enjoyable combat and engaging itemization, but its lackluster story holds it back from greatness. It’s definitely worth picking up on sale, but at its current full price, it’s a tougher sell.

If your going to do this. i want separate difficulty for both.

Can he kill stuff? yes. Does his methods feel counter to being an assassin yes.

What does this mean in practice? 
You will never use him because it feels dumb to see an item you want to pick up only to realize its un reachable unless you switch character, also feels bad that if you switch you need to turn up the difficulty to the max just to fill like the fighting is at least trying to keep you awake.

so you never use him.

190920448,english,"I will update my review when I finish the game.

Update: After beating the game I was still a bit underwhelmed. I wasn't able to enjoy the characters or story as the presentation and dialogue was janky as hell and broke immersion. Gameplay improved as your characters gained abilities. Item system was too basic, I would prefer we move away from 90% vendor trash systems (Dragon Age Veilguard had a good loot system). I dont like open ended stories that seem designed to sell me DLC. Had bugs with DLSS and Daggers which caused some performance issues and I wasnt able to use daggers throughout my playthrough. Not terrible but I was hoping to enjoy the story more than I did.

My first impressions of the game were good during the tutorial. However, now that I have made it to the open world my opinion of the game has started to change.

The most glaring problem with the game is the low quality facial animations. They are poor and seem to lack a lot of detail in close up cut-scenes. They are unable to convey any emotions, they are stiff, and they are bland. I cant tell if its lack of optimisation or if the engine needs improved.

Another issue with the game is dialogue. It doesn't seem natural or flow properly. It seems as though the lines were written separately and then patched together. It isn't helped when you interact with a NPC and they don't face you. They stare off into the distance and their idle animations trigger during conversation which looks silly.

Combat was initially decent. I wouldn't say it was bad and was enjoying it during the tutorial when I was fighting a small number of enemies. However when you trigger an alarm in the open world you can be surrounded by enemies and the combat starts to fall apart. The camera cant keep up and you will continually take attacks from enemies you cant see. The targeting keeps switching to enemies you don't want it to. When you parry an enemy and expose them, the character doesn't target the exposed enemy and targets a seemingly random enemy.

The localisation is poor. When you choose to play the game in immersive mode the language will be a mix of Japanese and Portuguese. My problem with it is the subtitles aren't a translation of the Japanese language. They are subtitles for the English language placed over the top of the Japanese dialogue. What the character is saying is sometimes completely different to what the subtitles are saying which has the opposite effect of immersion.

My initial impression of the game is that it falls short of what I expect from a polished AAA game. I think it can be polished to be a really good game if they can fix some of the janky facial animations, targeting issues, and working on the timing and delivery of dialogue. However we are talking about the same level of commitment Larian put into improving BG3 and Project Red put into improving Cyberpunk. I just don't think they are going to do it so I cant recommend the game in its current state. I would recommend it on sale or perhaps when I complete it, if I find enough good parts to outweigh the initial poor first impressions.",False,0,0,1742671731,76561198036864320,2880

As someone who enjoyed Odyssey and Valhalla, I feel as though Shadows keeps the Adventure RPG elements I enjoy about the recent entries, but also bringing back some of the need to be more methodical with the assassin mechanics like the older games. The difficulty and mechanics actually have a good amount of options to suit your play style. The graphics and scenery are as much of a visual treat as other recent entries. I feel like the game is taking an unnecessary amount of negative criticism from the sort of people who do not like that Ubisoft has continued to carry the franchise in the direction they have since Origins. For those who have been looking forward to another modern AC entry, I do recommend this game.

There are some things like the parkour or traveling on a horse that are not on par with the old games but that doesn't take away too much from the fun.

The combat and stealth are where the gameplay shines in my opinion. Both are challenging and rewarding while failing to be stealthy can be very punishing as Naoe.

The story is not super linear and due to that not as engaging as it could be but I didn't feel bored during any of the multiple story lines. There are a lot of long cutscenes, if you don't like that then this might bother you but for some reason this game was able to make playable flash backs with Naoe, that only show how she became a shinobi, super fun!

190918832,english,"The movement in this game is awful. There is no fluidity, the character doesn't do what you want her to do half of the time, and the controls are wildly unresponsive. When the game does what you tell it to and reacts how you would expect the game to react it's a great game. There just so many little instances where the flow of the game and combat is completely ruined due to the game not behaving at all the way you would expect. Shoulder high wall that you should be able to put your hands on and climb? nope can't do it, but if you got 3 feet to the left and try to climb the same wall it suddenly works no problem despite giving you an animation 3 feet away saying it wasn't possible. You get stuck on terrain and obstacles doing parkour even when you aren't using the parkour button and the game won't let to move until you engage the parkour button again. Stepped up to a rock 3 feet off the ground with out using the parkour button? the entire flow of your movement is halted until you engage the parkour button to jump down. despit not needing the parkour to be engaged to get there. You can't have dodge and parkour both on space so you're stuck finding a different key bind for your dodge, which I'm unsure if it's jsut me but having dodge on ALT when majority of games have jump/dodge on the same key is a weird choice and I often find myself pressing the space key to dodge and then not dodging and dying (partially my fault for not being able to adapt, but it's muscle memory). When you're holding shift to run/sprint and space to parkour and try turning your camera to change your direction or hop to a different roof most of the time the character will just keep moving. You've got to stop moving, finish the animation, and allow the character to adjust direction before continuing. some times the character adjusts quickly and it's not a big deal but about a half of the time she keeps moving and you're left to adjust your route and movement to not get caught or killed.

I will update the review to be positive if they fix the movement. In a game so centered around smooth movement and stealth game play, they really missed the mark in my opinion.

Overall the game is decent, There's just a lot of weird quarks with the movement that ruin the flow of the game and hold it back from being genuinely great. Those weird movement quarks will frustrate you beyond belief in some scenarios, if they can smooth those out in a patch and increase the flow of the game it would be really enjoyable to play.",False,0,1,1742670473,76561198267049176,3711

The first 2 hours are literally cut scenes, I didn't even bother waiting to see if I was going to actually see more combat to gauge the game in its entirety, you should be able to actually judge if you were going to enjoy a game in two hours, but there was almost nothing to gauge for 2 hours. 2. Fucking. Hours. There were maybe 10 combat instances tops within the first 2 hours, followed by literally nothing but cut scenes and walk cycles to other cut scenes. As a consumer, you should genuinely feel like you are being conned out of your money. There is literally one stealth instance in the first 2 hours, and you only get to play black man in the beginning of the game for 5 minutes tops. Literally the entire reason I bought this fucking game was to be black man, and for 2 fucking hours I watched Chinese girl very sad backstory super good fun time and she is so boring as character, just flooding her back story with tragedy for 2 nonstop hours. They cram the cut scenes down your throat, they feel almost purposely drawn out for padding, it becomes numbing so fast. Every single moment is Chinese girl overcoming some situation, leaving you completely disinterested to her within minutes.  Baseball bat to the fucking head! Her dad dieded! She shooted in her leg! Shortround nurses her back to health! Who the fuck actually cares lmfao. It's done so drawn out and exaggerated to be met with fucking awful combat. press right bumper forever, then your reward is another drawn out 7-10 minute cut scene, only half of which are even good looking, the cut scenes that are real time don't even look good. The 1 hour and 45 minutes of cut scenes are an attempt to fucking literally con you out of your money and just watch the movie as it brainlessly numbs you beyond the refund time block just spitting out AI written expository horseshit. Do not buy this game, literally just watch the cut scenes on YouTube for free, this game is an absolute scam. 20 million dollar budget my ass, this is a financial assets throwaway before they file for bankruptcy. If you have purchased this game, I highly consider you get a refund, this is a very obvious snub to you as a consumer and should be received as an absolute insult to your intelligence and an attempt to con you out of 60 dollars, nothing else. If you advocate for this game at all you are a shill, a purchased advertisement bot account or a mental invalid.

Pros: 
- Movement feels very fluid, much more variety in parkour points than seen in other games
- I enjoy the Hideout customizations.
- Crouch / Prone is REALLY cool and adds another layer of stealth depth to the game.

Cons:
- I'm not a fan of the Objective Page. Tabular form was always better, this feels more convoluted than it needs to be.
- Fighting style could use some more variation, the abilities do help though with creating your own customisation formats.
- The Scout System is cool at face value, but really lacks any substance and serves to annoy some players.

Even if this game had no story it would still be worth a buy just to experience the open world of Japan in a way that really hasn't been done before.

If there was one downside, I'd say it would be the slow start. The first 1-2 hours of the game are slightly disappointing. The game does not do a great job of storytelling; it blasts you with cutscene after cutscene and doesn't let you play the game for a while.

Graphics? STUNNING. The world-building is next-level, packed with detail, hidden secrets, and breathtaking landscapes. Every undiscovered section pulls you deeper in. This is peak Assassin’s Creed—Ubisoft really cooked with this one.

Also The Fact that you can change seasons (Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring) is so much better very few games do that.

190912448,english,"The Good:

• Graphics are nice.

• Landscapes are A LOT better than the old trilogy. Every step and angle looks like a photography. It's no longer a grass plain with a few rocks and trees, they are all interesting to explore and appreciate.

• The new cutscenes are great.

• I like how the protagonists participate in social events, parties and meetings from Feudal Japan. It makes these stories and characters more believables. Very immersive.

• Touching story with interesting character development. So far the best story I've seen in an AC game in a long time.

• Less Ubisoft-like icons. A way more natural and dynamic approach to exploration.

• Loot is less important, so leaving chests behind on outspots is not as punished as in the old trilogy. Finding chests now feels interesting, not a chore, which is nice.

• More varied gameplay loop: no longer based merely on visiting outposts - killing everyone - looting everything - finding next outpost. We now have housing, dynamic events, interesting side activities... More variation.

• Optimization is great. This game is running the same tech as Monster Hunter Wilds, which shortens development times at the cost of performance. However, AC Shadows runs pretty much ""as good as it can"" with the tech it's using.


The Bad:

• The combat style has received some tweaks, but I still don't think a souls-like combat gameplay fits Assassin's Creed. This game is supposed to be immersive, cool and badass. It should focus on looking realistic, cool and badass, not o focusing the enemy and rotate around him waiting for a parry like this is Dark Souls. Stabbing an enemy 67 times in a realistic immersive game like Assassin's Creed feels off and these janky goofy ass souls-like combat animations are absolutely immersion breaking.

• Naoe is the true protagonist. Not because Yasuke isn't cool or anything, but because he is so heavily nerfed in core mechanics he can't even reach some of the collectables: Yasuke can't climb and he is almost useless in stealth, while Naoe can do everything and she is simply a little bit less effective in combat (but she can still parry, block and deal damage). I like Yasuke as a character, but I'm having such a difficult time playing as him... Not being able to parkour nor do some basic stealth on an Assassin's Creed game is horrendous and such a huge nerf compared to what Naoe gets, which is simply a small combat damage reduction. There are not a lot of reasons to play as Yasuke and I think most people will simply stick to using Naoe, I think this has not been properly balanced nor considered and it kind of destroys the whole point of having two protagonists.


The Uggly:

• The game has a pretty weird personality I don't fully enjoy. It tries to incorporate japanese action and scenery elements typical from mangas or japanese cinematography, mixed with an intention of feeling youthful and modern... The mixure is weird and I don't know how to feel about it. I think it would have been preferable sticking to an OG PS3-era Assassin's Creed style, or a full classical japanese personality in the style of Ghost of Tsushima. This weird modern middle point is a little bit awkward sometimes.

• The game has some minor but frustrating bugs. Sometimes the music stops working and you have to quit and re-enter the game to get it back working. I've also encountered some instances where I assessinate enemies but they get up again with full health, putting an end to my stealth run. Pretty sure they'll get these fixed soon though, it's still a very polished game and I've not encountered any more major issues.

• While the new dialogue cameras are great, they still need to work on expressions. They still feel a little soul-less and robotic.


Conclussion:

Pretty good Assassin's Creed game so far. Enjoying it a lot. Fixes a lot of issues from previous AC RPG games such as those uninteresting landscapes (which now look amazing in Shadows), but also carries some of the issues from those ones such as the absolutely horrendous combat system.

It has some rough edges, but it's a pretty good Assassin's Creed game and, in my opinion, the best RPG-style game they have released so far.

Absolutely recommended.

190911215,english,"Assassin’s Creed Shadows – Reformed Doubter’s Take

I went in expecting Ubisoft formula fatigue.
Saw the trailers, saw the drama, rolled my eyes.
Now? 12 hours in.
And you know what?
They got this one mostly right.

🎌 Audio First: Japanese with English Subs = Must
This isn’t a “cool feature.” It’s borderline necessary.
The performances feel legit.
The vibe clicks better.
Characters make more sense.
Feels like the devs actually cared.

🔪 Gameplay: Not Groundbreaking, But Polished
You’ve got two characters:

The samurai: heavy, straightforward, honorable killer.

The shinobi: sneaky, tactical, ghost-mode operator.

Switching styles adds variety without feeling forced.
Combat isn’t revolutionary, but it’s fluid.
Stealth works. Finally.
You can play how you want without the game fighting you.

💻 Performance: Not Great, Even on a 3090
I’m averaging 60fps at 1440p on a 3090.
That shouldn’t be happening.
It’s not unplayable, but it’s not great either.
Expect dips, especially in towns or foliage-heavy areas.
Needs a patch. Straight up.

🧠 Story: Surprisingly Solid
The intro actually sets things up well.
Characters have weight, motivations make sense, and the world feels lived in.
It’s not Red Dead 2, but for AC?
Definitely top-tier opening act.

🧾 Final Verdict: Not Perfect, but Worth Playing
The internet hate?
Mostly noise.
If you like stealth, samurai stuff, or just want a visually sick open world to roam in, it delivers.
The performance issues knock it down a peg, but nothing game-breaking.
It’s not reinventing anything, but it doesn’t need to.

RATING: 8.4 / 10

Minus points for optimization.

Big ups for tone, art, and atmosphere.

190910481,english,"Visuals: 10/10 the game supports high quality visuals. Stunning graphics, beautiful colors, weather changes and a high attention to detail. They did well with the design of feudal Japan. Better with a nice set up of course.

Story: 6/10 I don’t care as much for the samurai. I just play the ninja and her story is decent.. seems a little rushed but not a bad story nonetheless. In my opinion, they could have left out the samurai entirely and made a better story with just the ninja. The samurai doesn’t suit the whole assassins creed vibe.. but that vibe was lost long ago anyways.

Mechanics/combat: 7/10 the movements and parkour are fluid and very well done. The combat can seem repetitive. However there are different weapons, enemies and abilities that can spice things up. Not as repetitive as ghost of Tsushima.

Atmosphere: 8/10 makes you feel like you’re in Japan. The atmosphere is very immersive especially with different weather and seasonal changes, however there could be more interaction among the NPC’s. They don’t do much except walk around which is common among most games.. if there was more interactions and things going on in the background, easily 10/10. I would recommend playing the game in Japanese with English subtitles for an extra layer of immersion but that's just me.

Audio/soundtrack/voice acting: 10/10 the soundtrack is awesome. Audio is well done. Voice acting is very well done as is most ac games.

I haven’t experienced bugs yet which is impressive for a just-released game.

All in all I’d say the game is a 7.5/10. Really strong in some areas and can be lacking in others. Still worth the full price in my opinion. It trumps ghost of Tsushima in almost all aspects aside from maybe the story. But the story in Ghosts wasn’t the best either in my opinion.

The world is gorgeous, and the vibe of feudal Japan is captured beautifully. The dual protagonists bring something fresh—both characters play differently but complement each other well. I’ve found myself switching between stealth and full-on combat naturally, which feels rewarding instead of forced.

Performance-wise, the usual Ubisoft nuance here and there but overall it’s been smooth for me, and the attention to detail is impressive. It still feels like Assassin’s Creed at its core but with some solid refinements and a fresh setting that really works.

Honestly, I think a lot of the backlash was just premature noise. Shadows is easily one of the stronger entries in recent years, and I’m glad I trusted my gut and gave it a shot. What happened to creative freedom??

It’s so effing boring…

I’m not biased as many ppl round here and I feel more or less ok towards Ubisoft (greedy bastards though), they’ve had many good games so I’m quite neutral here. But it’s all over again, same assassin with a corny background story, parents murdered, revenge, blah blah, bad cult kills good people, revenge again… Same lame dialogues, same lame story, same camps to loot, same resources and castles to pillage… I’ve done it thousand times before and I’m bored to death.

Music-wise I’m shocked. I’ve always loved music in Ubisoft games, it’s one of their strengths, but this time… what is it? rock music in feudal Japan? what the fu… anachronism, are you mad? 

I’ll never make it to gay romances you guys are so afraid of, or rise of black samurai… because I don’t even care what happens next to main character(s), nothing new I suppose. The game is terribly repetitive and dull. English voiceover is awful. Why not take on professional English-speaking actors? Voices are as dull as everything in this game. After 12h in game, I’m so sick and tired of it. New decorations, same old story.

They had… how many years of development? Plus several months of delay. Thousands of people were working on the game, it was Ubisoft’s last chance… and they did this?! Really? Is it their best?
And I don’t even mention a bunch of technical problems. The mystery of missing DLSS, for instance.

190906627,english,"I want to start this review off by saying I hate ubisoft games nowadays. Skull and Bones TRASH, Star Wars Outlaws, TRASH, and so on. Ubisoft just doesnt make good games anymore, however when it comes to Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are things I can really take away from the experience, and there are things I can't. So Some Pro's I will mention so far:
1. The Female Main Character has a  good story so far, especially when you're hunting down this games version of ""Templars"" The actionss you can take really do immerse you into the fold. I play this game on Expert Stealth, and even though it can be a pain at times, it does add another layer of challenge to the story itself.
2. I love the Outpost  mechanic, and the stealth mechanics. The Outpost  has room for creativity, and you can actually buy a lot of cosmetic items from vendors in game for ""Mon"" currency.
3. The world design is lowkey beautiful. Ubisoft always does know how to do map design, and this place is no different.
For Some Cons:
1. The Performance on PC. I have a monster PC, and even on the lowest setting I'm struggling to maintain 60fps in small towns. SMALL towns. There's no option to turn off RAy Tracing, There's no Option for Fullscreen, And the guide for Performance boosting in the game is horrendous.
2. Combat can be smooth, but also Wonky. If you play on a controller, it's going to be a little tough fighting in small closed in areas especially. The camera doesnt like to adjust itself and so it glitches through walls, which on Expert Difficulty can cost you the entire fight. Sometimes animation cancelling isn't a thing, but the combat is actually pretty difficult. Which is what I like.

190905425,english,"I'm actually enjoying the time in ACS so far. Biggest plus: They finally realized releasing on Steam is a good thing.

A brief list:

+ I enjoyed it way more than Valhalla and the first hour. Where in Valhalla you would run to the next mission, you would have completed 1-hour long, story-oriented missions in AC Shadows...
+ I think it's a cool new idea to have two different protagonists. Great to have them trying out new things. I however prefer Naoe as it brings the real assassin-vibe. But the certain story missions with Yasuke are cool too.
+ Awesome graphics, atmosphere and visual style
+ I like the Japan setting
+ The map feels reasonable size, not too overwhelming and not too small. Good size.
+ The areas feel well-thought and allow for a good assassin-like gameplay: Many buildings, many natural hiding spots.
+ I find the new mission-finding-style great: to elaborate... You get a vague description where next mission is and you need to either send out spies or get your own butt there and look for the next mission NPC/startpoint. Feels more immersive.
+ While I'm personally not a ""decoration-type of guy"", I still enjoy the idea of the hideout and be able to customize your gear there. To build something up yourself throughout the campaign.
+ I like the many cutscenes in the game, feels very story-oriented.
+ Many great settings to customize experience, ranging from graphics, and gameplay settings like precise difficulty settings or if mission points should be marked, etc
+ The game feels very, very polished - I had two bugs: 1) One enemy got stuck, 2) Sound glitches out after some playtime, but there's a workaround for it
+ Provides support for newer tech features like DLSS, FSR, Frame Generation, etc (not all Ubisoft titles do)

~ The facial animations are a bit outdated... they don't feel right.
~ Some hideout things feel odd. You can place animals at certain spots, which is great. But they are fixed at their respective spots. They don't wander and run around the buildings. So much missed potential...
~ I don't like the kiji-kiri. It's cool at first, but it rather gets slightly annoying over time. 

- Microtransactions. Absolute crap.
- Repetitive missions (non-story) like collecting resource for hideouts, gear crafting/upgrades. I find them enjoyable at first, but they wear out pretty quickly. Some might like it and find it good to ""turn their brain off and enjoy"", but I don't.
- I personally don't like the level scaling. All enemies scale with your level, so they are always somewhat a challenge. I feel like it would be more realistic to have them at their respective level in the starter areas (which you probably won't visit anymore anyway)
- I don't like that on every fast-travel point the environment gets reset. Once you clear an entire area, loot everything and be proud; it's just all reset on your next visit. Feels very disappointing and almost time was wasted.

Overall enjoyable IMHO.

190905216,english,"Edit: Returning now after finishing the main story and most of the side assassinations, I think my original score of 6-7/10 is accurate, but not a ridiculous ""internet"" 6-7/10, an actual one, meaning above average.

The Good: The game has a stunning world, satisfying combat system especially once you start unlocking skills and the best stealth gameplay in the modern series of AC games, the game allows you adjust it's settings so you can practically play it like it's AC1 in terms of the actual assassination gameplay, with a mix of Tenchu style items and skills mixed in.

I played with ""guaranteed assassinations"" turned on and the game on the hardest difficulty, this helped make stealth feel really rewarding to do well and punishing to fail at until much further in the game, but I still had to play well even after I had unlocked the strongest abilities.

Also a decent amount of outfits and weapon designs to play with and if you can be bothered, the daily missions allow you to progress a free ""battlepass"" to earn shop cosmetics for free (I never bought anything from the store).

The Average: Side content is mediocre but isn't time consuming to do, so this resulted in it being inoffensive, but also not exciting, with the only real reason to do it being that it has good rewards in skills.

The base building was a nice idea but doesn't serve much outside of needing to upgrade a few of the buildings for mechanics.

The Problems: The major problem game has is that 50% of the assassination targets should just have been removed as they give nothing to the story or characters, that effort should have gone into making the set pieces of the major assassination targets even bigger and better.

Because of this bloat, the story is lost for hours on end and results in it being difficult to really attach to anyone, especially with two different protagonists with almost no real interconnecting story or moments together. Putting most of the interesting story at the very beginning and the very end really didn't do much and it's clear this is where the game struggled most.

Also the shop is crap like always, I know we all know that execs force the developers to put these things in there, but between the prices and the cosmetics themselves being mediocre, it's just an eyesore and embarrassment to have it in a single player game. Stop doing it.

Conclusion: A fine game, if you enjoy the Japanese aesthetic and open worlds, it's probably the best looking version of that, if like me you also miss gameplay like the Tenchu series, this offers a familiar feeling when playing as Naoe.

Ultimately there are better games out there and certainly worse games out there, I don't think it's worth full price, but in a sale, I'd say it's alot easier to recommend, despite still feeling some of that ""chore"" like nature to a big chunk of the mid-game, I still kept wanting to come back each day as the simple Assassin fantasy is good enough.

OLD 6 Hours in Launch review

If you don't like newer AC games, this is probably the best of the newer style, offering a few options that allow for more old school style play as well, but it is still the same type of game as Odyssey for example, so take that as you will. 

I strongly recommend if you like the older style of AC games, you play it on expert mode with ""Guaranteed assassinations"" turned on as it forces me to actually plan what I do and play safe, while actually rewarding me for doing so.

The beginning was a bit slow and I did almost give up because it wasn't grabbing me, but I'm genuinely glad I didn't. once you get your freedom and I started finding different kinds of gear, choosing how I want to engage with each situation and unlocking new skills, it pushed the game up to a 8/10 quite quickly.

The world is genuinely impressive looking, especially on stronger hardware (I'm mid range) and I've only had one crash which didn't cause me to lose any progress.

No it's not a 10/10, but it's absolutely not below a 6/10 either, where it goes in between will be down to your own personal preferences.",True,0,0,1742660463,76561197977643632,3542

190904190,english,"I am enjoying it but wow I hate the stupid level-gated ""open world"".  No the world itself - it is beautiful, lush, and a joy to explore.  I hate that if I cross an invisible line while out exploring the open world, my weapons become useless because the enemy level is 3x what my level is.  I really wish Ubisoft would have learned from Ghost Recon Breakpoint that some players want immersion over grinding gear score.  I'm not saying they should remove gear score entirely because I know some people enjoy that style of play.  I am saying they should simply add an option in the settings that always equalizes the player to the enemies behind the scenes, thus reducing/eliminating the HUD and need to constantly pause the game to change clothes/weapons.  I could go anywhere in Ghost Of Tshushima and explore the world as I saw fit.  Of course there were more difficult enemies, but it was because they were better trained and had better equipment - not because of some arbitrary # on the screen.  Gear score is fine in games like The Division where the looter shooter mechanic is a backbone of the series.  AC games historically have been quasi-realistic.  I know they used gear score in Odyssey and Origins, coincidentally my least favorite games of the series and the only 2 I haven't finished, but the rest of the series did not.

Please add a true immersive mode option in a future patch.  Some of us want to get lost in the game world.  Not have to worry about accidentally crossing an invisible line or pausing the game every 3 minutes to make sure we have the best gear on.

Aside from that, I love the game.  It's absolutely gorgeous and has by far the most fluid movement of the series (parkour, combat).  I also like the story, characters, and world.  I just wish I could get fully immersed in the game instead of my immersion constantly being broken up by non-logical gamified mechanics like gear score.",True,0,0,1742659773,76561198239721244,4310

190898694,english,"So Here's the thing,

I've played every single Ac game there's been. We've had some major ups and downs over the years for sure. Putting aside the drum beat everyone's been hammering to about the DEI and all that jazz, here's what I like, and don't about Shadow's thus far. 

-Pro's
- Beautiful environment
- Immersion (when it wants to be, more in the con section) 
- Combat is decently engaging
- There can be a challenge (if you want) 
- Armor and weapon design feel like there was some ok thought put into it.

Now for the cons 

- Optimization (Seriously we had many delays... what were we doing Ubi?) 
- awful I MEAN AWFUL load times. You get to a new section of an area too fast? Load time. You in the middle of a cutscene? Freeze frame, into Load time. You tryna find resources in an area with too many Npc's? Npc turn to clay + Load time. YOU ARE BEING HUNTED BY ENEMIES GUESS WHAT? THEY GET STUCK IN A LOAD TIME. You can deal damage to them but, They. Will. Never. Draw. Their. Weapon. 

-Voice acting. DO NOT PLAY IN ENGLISH. MY DRUNK FRIENDS AND I COULD DO A BETTER ATTEMPT AT BEING JAPANESE. 

-The obvious DEI crap and blatant pandering for shareholders. 

- Don't trust your settings menu, the game will say it's in performance mode and change 0 about itself. 


Game could be a solid 7/10 for me if Ubi wouldn't release these things like a dumpster fire. Right now, with no opti patches 4/10. The Only thing making this game playable is the Nexus Mod stutter fix. Shameful.

190898688,english,"I have been largely against the new direction Assassin's Creed has taken with their recent string of RPG games. Everything from the lack of proper stealth, lack of 'Creed' representation in the story that respects the lore that made AC what it is today, and the god awful parkour system, I really thought that this franchise was going to be over with no sign of redemption.

Assassin's Creed Shadows fixes very few of these issues, however the attention to stealth given in this game has actually had me enjoying myself sneaking around Castles (this games version of outposts) and assassinating the Captains. Being based in Japan has made it easier to enjoy than I thought, the game is gorgeous, and the environments are breathtaking at times. I've yet to use the horse mount in the game just purely so I can slow walk through paths and take in all the scenery I can.

This games combat is still awful, and the movement/parkour leaves so much to be desired, however I will mention that some of the new animations given to Naoe when jumping off ledges has made it entertaining to at least try some cool parkour combos. I've played Yasuke as little as humanly possible, his entire playstyle goes against the ethos of Assassin's Creed and I look forward to the time that Ubisoft actually swallows its' pride and gives us a game worthy of the franchises' name.

If the RPG games were labeled as something else, I'm sure they'd do wonders. But labeling it as ""Assassin's Creed"" inherits the expectation that you'll at least try to stay faithful to the material that made Assassin's Creed so fun. It feels as though they wanted to make a new IP but we're nervous about how successful it could be, so they instead used the AC name to bolster it's popularity and peoples desire to play it.

I've been a fan of the Assassin's Creed series since it all started. Assassin's Creed II will forever and ALWAYS remain the GOAT in my book. The new style of RPG Assassin's Creed has grown on me even though I was weary of it when it was introduced in Origins. Odyssey was my favorite of the two do to my love of Greek Mythology but damn.. Shadows is giving it a run for it's money. I've played a total of 8ish hours and I can honestly say I'm in love. Currently, I'm exploring the BEAUTIFUL open world and it's just that, breathtaking.

Then I started playing ACS. Forget free roaming, that's over, you're now stuck to following paths everywhere, I mean you can attempt to go cross country but all you see is a black screen and the occasional outline of your toon before it plummets back down from what ever you just 10 minutes trying to climb.

Oh it's also almost certainly night, & raining. It's hard to tell tbh because it's pretty much pitch black during the day too.

You probably can climb down buildings but I've not figured out how,  I've only been playing since AC III so I must be a novice.

Combat is still clunky, unless you stand still. You come out of crouch constantly, & for some reason need to stop moving to be able to, eagle vision is annoyingly bad & there's no eagle anymore. They have improved dodge though, which is nice, problem most of the time I back flip into some immovable object off screen and get stuck, (in the dark), trying to figure out which way to go.

-Looks prety good.
-Knwoledge and skill point system
-the side objectives are good. a simple meditation has its own story(the first 4 sadly) I like the tombs and parkour activities. 
-the black and white effect on target assasination is cool
-I like the season change stuff. > new rumours, scouts, quests etc
-most of the gear looks great
-basic sprint speed is fast. Edit: only with Naoe, i can't feel the same with yasuke. 
-the loot level is scaling in the older regions.
-the shadow barrage ability is super fun. 
-The castles are unique!! Every fortres are different.
-the music is incredible
-The exploring is greater then ever
-the weather and weather change
-The first time in Azuchi. The best city for me.
-The abundance of trees and bushes in the forests. It feels real

What has been improved compared to the previous ones:
-the objectives menu is super cool. I love it. Finaly it is not a simple jornual + there is a lot of fun targets. For example the butterfly collectors, the twisted tree with the big fight, the kabukimono, the winter raiders.
-The observation(right click) is good. You can sense a lot of loot and objective(the blue and white ones). better then the old ""press v""
-There is no more 5000 random box for 3 gold thanks. The meaning full lootable stuffs are close together. It makes you feel better in town. You dont need go to every house 
-Hideout is much better then valhalla. 
-The follow option for quests
-There is no underwater this time

bad:
-there is no auto loot with assasinate
-The tempo weapon. I dont know why but it is frustrating to play with the rifles. On 5 knowledge level/full upgraded still weak. 
-enemy AI is to stupid.
-Most of the ability's damage is mehh 
-The kakurega's are to expensive. I spent most of my money for unlockong it...(you can unlock 92)
-Running with yasuke. He stops at every destroyable objective. Okey it good for doors but an option would be nice to turn off on random objects.
-there is no daily quest for animus projects. The weekly is also not enough :|
-manual save limit...
-When you call your horse that is nearby, it doesn't behave the same as when you call it from nowhere.
-Naganita and kusarigama abilitys are locked for to long


bad and good:
-cant climb mountains

bugs:
-stealth kill is buged sometimes. you can kill 3-4 times the target. its bonus xp XD

190893187,english,"’ve spent about 9 hours playing this game, and as a longtime fan of the franchise since Assassin’s Creed 2, I really wanted to enjoy it. Unfortunately, the game still feels like it’s stuck between two identities—trying to merge the classic stealth-action style of the older titles with the RPG elements introduced in recent entries. While some players might appreciate this hybrid approach, for me, the more I play, the more frustrating it becomes. It feels like the series has lost its original essence in an attempt to cater to a broader audience.

One of the biggest disappointments for me was the in-game store. I was already struggling to stay engaged, but when I found out that you can literally spend real money to buy a pack that reveals the entire map, along with cosmetics and some of the best gear in the game, it completely killed my motivation. Instead of encouraging exploration and rewarding players for their time and effort, the game essentially puts a price tag on progression.

I understand that modern games often include microtransactions, but this level of monetization feels excessive. It takes away the sense of discovery and accomplishment that made older Assassin’s Creed games so engaging. Overall, while the game has some redeeming qualities, the combination of forced RPG mechanics and aggressive monetization makes it difficult for me to enjoy. I really hope the franchise finds a better balance in the future.
In my opinion games that charge you $70 should not have a store selling extra this on the game, specilaty a single player game.

The game play is actualy good on the begining, after a feal hour start to get repetiti, because ubsoft want a lot a mini games or other types of activitis that is only fun if you do one or two time, but if you want to evolve you will need to complete the major side quest.",False,0,0,1742651999,76561198202523940,1757

190892908,english,"Honestly, the game really isn't that bad. I know it's super controversial right now, and it doesn't help that Ubisoft is such a lowlife, scumbag of a company. With that in mind, the game is honestly fun. I mean, it's an Assassin's Creed game set in Japan; everyone wanted something like this since the very first Assassin's Creed game came out. The gameplay isn't bad, the combat is actually pretty fun, and it felt a lot less repetitive than the last couple of AC games released. The thing I hate about this game is the fact that I got to play it for two hours when it first came out, and suddenly the game crashed, leaving me with a completely unplayable bug that made it impossible to even launch the game. For anyone that is having a similar issue, if the game keeps crashing at 93% when it is initially loading, you have to completely remove any source of wifi or ether from your PC and delete your saved game files. Once you've done this, you can load into the game and restart the game all over until you can make a save file. From there you can reconnect your wifi or ether and continue playing the game as normal. The fact that they released this with a bug that is game-breaking is absolutely insane, especially when you're a company as large as Ubisoft. Onto the realm of microtransactions: If this is such a big deal to you, then you should know that you can easily get around paying money by simply using Cheat Engine. Just a big FYI to everyone, the last couple of games had this same issue, and the amazing cheat engine community had developed a way to unlock every single DLC for free. Just saying, if you hate a feature that much, then you should know that there are plenty of ways around it. All in all, the game is pretty fun, if you can play it.

Unfortunately I can’t give an actual review yet, need to wait for a mod or patch to correct this since I wasn’t able to figure it out since it’s not a setting in the .ini file….",False,0,0,1742651171,76561198082640116,569

-if you want to access the store or projects and it errors or doesnt load, unlink an account for your ubisoft and itll fix (this should be patched soon and you can relink whenever you want)
-the ""battle pass"" is not P2W like people claimed because these projects are free and have no paid aspects.

190888433,english,"I am a big fan of open world games and many of the Ubisoft games. So far this one has been nothing but a test of patience. I keep wondering, when will the game start? But I am 12 hours in at this point, and so far I have just plowed through an endless amount of cutscenes and really bland boring conversations, like ""Hello"", ""hello"", ""how are you"", ""not bad"", ""okay, so whats up"", ""nothing much, and you?"", ""yep same same""...

What bothers me the most is how the reward system is balanced. For example, for a complex assassination you will get only 10 XP points. Making it basically pointless to spend time on this aspect of the game, while I always find this was one of the more fun aspects of these games. Stealth kills, using your wits to get the best of the enemy.

On the other hand, chasing the boring things, like enduring endless conversations and moving along in the story give you massive amount of XP points. Mundane tasks like walking around some shrine and watching four boring pray animations will give you a massive 500 XP. That's 50 stealth kills basically, for just walking around scratching your *ss.

I suppose the message here is the game wants you to explore ancient Japan, and reward you like you are in a museum, guiding your hand making sure you see everything. The open world aspect is kind of closed down, the maps are designed with many areas that is hard to traverse, even with your superhero parkour skills. Climb huge buildings and make impossible jumps along the top of tall poles, no problem. Try to jump over a small rock in a forest nope, it is an invisible wall masked as a stone to keep you inside the narrative of the game. Quite irritating, its like Ubisoft regret making Open World games, and try hard to close it down again but gets frustrated as Assassin Creed is already defined as Open World.

The game is also way too easy. I chose the hardest difficulty level, but it can be played blindfolded, especially due to the mentioned focus on just wandering around talking and exploring. But even if it does come to fighting, it is easy. The only thing that matter is the level difference between you and the opponents. Fight someone on your level or below, instant victory. Two levels or more above, dont even bother to try, it is programmed to make you lose. It is also so easy to hide or run away from a fight. Noone follows you on the rooftops for example. The enemy goes like ""you cannot hide!"", then a second later they give up and just wander away.

The whole fighting aspect is now only about level difference. Like it is a boolean operation in a computer program. It is a shame, I love the concept of using clever traps or strategy to take out enemies way above your level, but you are pretty much boxed in to dealing with them in the order the game is programmed to. 

On the positive side of things, the game looks wonderful. Finally water has gotten proper raytraced reflections. Everything is detailed, and there is paid a lot of attention to small historical details. As a kind of digital museum, this is worth it, as a traditional Assassin Creed game, its strolled too far off base now to try satisfy a larger audience.",False,0,0,1742648233,76561197966558357,1122

Currently still playing Naoe after the prologue, don't know how Yasuke gameplay would feel yet but idc.
I play AC games for assassination, not for combat.

Pros:-
-Parkour feels smooth and probably the best so far comparing this to Mirage is huge upgrade.
-Stealth is feels great especially with the new prone mechanic.
-Combat with Naoe is okay since she is not to be so combatant as she is stealth prio.
-The contracts reminds me of the birdcage contracts you get AC4 Black Flag which is fun to do imo.

Cons:-

-Bugs (glitchy kind)
-Can't play on hdd/slow ssd
-Climbing up hill feels really annoying especially with the camera panning automatically
-Combat lock on sucks
-Fps feels really choppy when going through foliage/bushes/trees
-Characters lips only in sync with the English dub and not other language (specifically Japanese)

The gear looks great, I find the combat to be fun, but I always did because it's challenging especially when multiple enemies fight you. I had to turn it down to normal combat difficulty because I had to relearn how to play this game. PC controls are hard to get used to also. 

Easy transmog system in place which is good. The world is pretty big, sometimes feels the same as Valhalla in a bad way. You still focus the loot on the map and the points of interest. If nothing's there then why go there kind of situation.

190881958,english,"Safe to say that this is the ""revival"" of the series. 

Gameplay overall feels amazing with a huge world to explore and admire. Lots of activity around the map that keeps you entertained all the time. The choice of how you move is all yours, you can just go from point A to B, or you can tackle camps, do kattas or kuji kiri, explore caves, do sync points and much more, keeps you from getting boored. 

Combat feels great, takes quite a skill gap and a learning curve. Again, choice is yours here, play as Naoe and try your best attempt at being a true shinobi that takes advantage of stealth and her many tools like kunais, smoke bombs etc, or play as Yasuke and go head first into any combat situation. At first glance it may look like ""button mashing"", but it aint like that at all, it takes skill, timing and using your arsenal the right way and i like that.

Stealth is finally back. If you play as Naoe it trully feels like the good old times, maybe not quite like some of the fans wanted, but i can tell you it's really good. You can go and take out an entire castle if you plan everything to perfection and not a single soul knew what hit them. The best part of it..you are free to do anything the way you want, your style. That makes it feel a lil bit more just like back in the day.

Parkour is another big part of the game (ofc if you play as Naoe cuz Yasuke can barely climb something haha). Is it like the old days ? Depends what you are looking for and how biased you are. To me honestly it feels really good, she moves fast, she's very nimble, climbs fast, the hook is spot on one of the best tools you have at your disposal, and those damn flips going down or simply moving around smaller objects are the icing of the cake tbh. 

Other honorable mentions are the hideout feature (it had me down on my knees the very moment i unlocked it and i saw the true potential), story line, mocap, facial expressions, voice acting are all pretty well done. Optimization i would say it's pretty decent with some questionable options but i won't go into that since im no expert. My pc is pretty old (rocking a I7 7700k with a GTX 1080) and with a mix of medium-high and even some ultra settings the game is breathtaking and i can keep it at a safe 60-80fps all the time. Is there room for improvement in the optimization departament ? Safe to say, yes. But overall a good experience if we think about what we saw from Ubi in the past. 

In the end, if you are a fan of the good old days of Assassin's Creed where you really felt like an assassin and also some RPG style mechanics gameplay, i can gladly recommend this to you. Good job for this one Ubisoft.

190881501,english,"Incredibly bland and boring, I have never seen a more stupid setup for getting a home base. The writing is abysmal. The english VO is terrible, especially Naoe. You HAVE to play on immersive mode / japanese and just get used to reading subtitles. The graphics are great. After playing Rise of the Ronin the gameplay and combat seem clunky as hell. And the characters so bland looking. My silent protag in Ronin was better, the outfits were better, the storybeats better. I really am so sad I bought this, I will try and get through to see if there is any magic anywhere, but...  

Updated longer review: 

This game is not very good. 

I loved AC Origins and Odyssey, but Valhalla was blander and the MC female was far too manly. I love Rpgs but I play all kinds of games as long as they are third person. 

I like to play as a character that I admire or want to emulate. As a female I prefer playing women, and beauty, charm, cool outfits, femininity, snark, spice, and animation goes a long way. But I can play as a cool dude, or a different character if it is a good character. Geralt, Aloy, etc. And i will play as any ""thing"" if the game is really good. Which in that case it is not about immersing myself into the character but about enjoying the story, or playing this very satisfying gameplay-loop, or exploring this very interesting place etc.

I really actually enjoy the modern music show downs, which some people I see do not. For me it reminds me of Kill Bill. And is a bit badass. I enjoy learning new weapons and progressing my talent trees. I somewhat also enjoy the combat. Its not too important to me anyway. All in all the gameplay is okay. It has pluses and minuses. 

The problems:

The MC is completely and utterly uninteresting. And outside of just having a run-of-the-mill goodie-two-shoes personality which is forgivable.. I just dont want to immerse myself in being Naoe. She is not beautiful, hot, conniving, clever or charming. There is no interest in me to watch her communicate or move or wear outfits. She doesnt inspire me. You cannot change her awful hair, and the hoods often emphasize her less feminine features. So in the end she just feels like a could-have-been-anything dot you control in a videogame.

Similar to Naoe, the other characters are forgettable. I would say Yasuke seems more interesting than any of them, but also so far seems like just the random hero in a childrens story type. 

It really does feel sometimes like this game was written as a collaboration in a ""learn-to-write"" class. Which pulled alot of information about Japan out of wikipedia and weaved it in where there was room. There is NO interesting lore so far. I cant even be bothered to read their ""glowing notes about the place"" - thingys they keep floating in the air here and there to explain a place or setting. And I LOVE lore. I always read everything, take Skyrim's books even with the long-ass tales of some war. And I find Japan interesting and cool and beautiful in general.

The land IS beautiful to look at. But there is no mystery, no little immersive sidequests and it lacks life. Animals are there to look at and will not attack you and you cannot kill them. Which for some reason is described as a positive. It makes roaming the wilderness, or swimming in the ocean, completely uninteresting and unimmersive. There could have been some tension, some stakes, but they opted for toddler friendly environments. Which stands completely opposite to being able to decapitate humans and turn them into bloody pulp btw. Its like the group decided what offends them and doesnt and went with that instead of writing a good story. 

And tombs, which could have been mystical, scary and have dangers, only have crockery and some loot. Thats it. So worth going into..

You can go inside lots of buildings. But there is nothing there. Some decorations, a low table, a pillow. Another backdrop that is uninteractive, and uninteresting. You dont find any personality, no-one lives there. You never walk into any interesting scene. No-one ever tells you to get out. Or even is there to say anything. Nobody is even home, unless they are bandits - then they sit there and stare at a wall waiting patiently for you to assassinate them. 

So in the end all of the environment is more like a pretty backdrop, a screensaver, than something you can get into. Which makes it just feels like the could-have-been-anything maze / jumping level your dot moves in.

I hate how sticky the parkour feels, I try to jump somewhere and Naoe gets stuck trying to climb a ladder, or starts climbing up when Im trying to go down, or stops when I want to jump. It feels like all the surfaces are glue. This I think is in trying to make it very easy to jump, climb, and etc, they have made it less of an art. You dont have to learn it, and you dont get good at it. It takes no skill outside of holding down a button and choose a direction. Which is yet another unimmersive element.

It could have felt very sweet to master the combat and the parkour and move in the environment and feel like a bloody athletic wonderchild. But nope. It just feels like a bit pointless after a while. You dont learn anything, you dont overcome anything, and you are not going anywhere new and interesting. Just swap the backdrop for painting nr 4, and repeat gameplay dot jumps to ledge b, and drops to floor 2 and stabs foe 7.

At this point I am only playing this because I bought it, and I have nothing else to play atm. But alot of the time it feels like a chore to get through the lull between main missions, and then when there is a good scene or moment it feels like a mid tv-show that I decided to marathon. 

The story to start was very cliche, and well into act 2 it still is, but now I have started to get somewhat invested. It had some highs and is not only bland. But it is like porridge with butter and cinnamon. Its mostly porridge, feeds you, and is sometimes tasty. But you would not order it in a restaurant. And certainly not pay premium.

I will not recommend this game until it costs about 5 Euros. Then have your porridge and beautiful screensavers.",False,0,0,1742642136,76561197988531103,3325

190880118,english,"TL;DR for those of you who want it. This is one of the best looking games of all time, One of the best ubisoft releases on launch. But if you like normal combat, even if your a diehard Assasins creed fan and don't like assassin gameplay as much as normal combat do not buy this game until they fix the normal combat, even if its 10 bucks tomorrow. If you even kind of like assasins creed and are a big fan of assassin combat then buy this game when its at 50/55 bucks or lower but if they fix the 2 main issues with the game buy it at full price. For most people though I would say wait until the game is 40 bucks and then buy it. 

I feel like moist assassins creed games boil down to two questions these days:
Is this game actually good or another mid ass assassins creed game. 
The simple answer to me (SO FAR) is this game is legitimately good and not just a mid ass filler/junk food game (even though there's nothing wrong with that imo)

and then the follow up question:
Is it worth full price on launch?
NO. Absolutely not there are few games that are worth 70 dollars period and assassins creed is no exception to this. HOWEVER this is the first assassins creed game that I have ever bought on launch and this game made me genuinely think about if it was worth the 70 dollar price tag because this game is legitimately good,

I'm gonna put out some bullet points to organize my thoughts in a list on what i think so far relative to the other assassins creed games I've played since i was a teenager (list of said AC games ive played so you can determine if you think my opinion is valid. AC 2 and 3 not finished, Black Flag not finished, Rogue not finished, Syndicate, Origins finished twice, Odyssey, Valhalla not finished)

Since I've been nice so far ill start with the good of this game
- The gameplay loop is as. if not more, satisfying and addictive as ever
- The story is surprisingly not that bad, tropes/cheesy/corny writing aside, the characters are interesting however I've only played one side of the story and i get side tracked on side quests a lot so I'm not that deep in.
- The base building mechanic with the hideout is so fucking satisfying idk what it is in my brain but the base building scratches some itch in there, It's not perfect, there's a few things id like to see be done better but overall its pretty good.
- The side quests so far are legitimately fun to follow instead of someones in danger go kill people over and over again. for instance there's a side quest where you do that but for a dog, which doesn't sound like a lot but you would be surprised how different it feels when your doing it for a dog lmao.
- Movement in this game feels good for the most part i haven't come across any game breaking/immersion ruining situations where it feels like i should be able to jump but I can't or something along those lines. The grapple is fun to use, a bit slow for my taste, but i understand why they had to make it that way and it is still fun to use so i don't mind.
- (playing on highest difficulty) The assassin gameplay feels so incredibly good it doesn't feel too easy but it doesn't feel too hard, the new mechanics with being hidden in shadows with dynamic lighting does feel a bit powerful but it by no means makes the assassin gameplay feel mindless or easy it also creates a lot of unique and fun scenarios that you cant get otherwise. There's also a lot of unique upgrades that look super fun that I haven even gotten to get into yet as I'm not that far. There is a dark side to this however but ill get to that in the other section.
- HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL. Straight up this might be one of the most beautiful pieces of media, much less games in existence and I've at the very least seen decent portions of every AAA game on crazy good hardware max setting etc etc as well as some of the best shot movies and the most beautiful manga and comic panels of all time and this game takes the cake by a long shot (not jojos tho nothing is more beautiful than that). When i run around in this world it genuinely feels real but also like I'm running around in an oil painting or a film shot on 35mm directed by Matt Reeves, Stephen Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, whatever else fucking director you wanna name that makes beautiful cinema. The craziest part is that I have to keep my settings middle of the road so I haven't even seen what the game loos like at its best.

Alright now the bad, there's not a lot but what bad there is is pretty fucking bad
- Dread it, run from it, no matter what I do, I can't escape that fucking ubisoft logo, they cant stop publishing unfinished and poorly play tested fucking games at full price. Credit where credit is due this game is not as bad some of their other ones however the AI tries its fucking damnedest to ruin my immersion at any point it can i swear. The game isn't nearly as bad as previous ubisoft titles I've seen at launch however I'm not gonna say that it's ok to release a game with blatant bugs and poor optimization for older and even mid range pcs. As much as I gush about how good this game looks my computer is by no means old it was mid to high end when i built it in 2022 and then it got a 3070 a year ago however I have to run this game at mid range settings in order to get a playable experience.  
- (fair warning I have only played Naoe on the hardest difficulty so far and she is focused on assassin gameplay which feels great but my problems are with other stuff) The normal combat system is so fucking broken and unplayable. That's a bit strong but its not hyperbole or exaggeration because the systems in place for the normal combat is absolutely stellar and makes every fight feel like you can lose but you can also win based on how well you play it out. The combat system is phenomenal on paper, however, and I'm not sure if this is an intended feature or a bug, if you are fighting more than one isolated opponent at a time the fight is unwinnable just straight up, 2 is very winnable but feels wrong, you are better off running away and coming back to reattempt your assassination or kill one run away then come back with them having fewer numbers. I believe they tried to implement a system in which you have multiple people attacking you at once and you have to parry, multi parry, or dodge whichever one lunges at you first. But because the core combat system is so good there's a lot of attacks that you have to be fully paying attention to, on top of the fact that there are so many different enemy classes,  because the windups for them are very subtle so it is impossible to tell who is attacking you in time so when you have a brute, 2 swordsmen, a spearman, 2 gunmen and 3 archers all attacking you at the same time it is impossible to win. There's also a lock on feature so you can single out one enemy to fight in a horde akin to Black flag or literally any other videogame with large scale combat post Zelda Ocarina of Time so that you don't get dog piled by attacks that you cant see but this feature in fact makes it worse because now the enemy will try their best to get behind you so even if you had Tenz level reaction speeds and could parry in time now you cant even do that because you cant see the enemy. 
Sorry if this is a little rant-y I'm writing this at 5 in the morning because I was up all night playing the game because everything else is either really good or fantastic, this as well if it weren't for the dogshit AI because I think after 20 years Ubisoft still hasen't hired anyone for their QA department if they even have one.

(take this last bit here with a grain of salt I only have 30 hours in so the story could tank but everything else would still stand. Also its 5 AM for me after I typed OOT i started feeling loopy) This game has the potential to be the best game of the year, possibly even the decade honestly if they fix the 2 main issues with it and GET A FUCKING QA TEAM PLEASE UBISOFT Thank you for coming to my ted talk",True,0,0,1742640784,76561198327530236,3592

STEALTH - 
True AC stealth is back ,is fun

COMBAT- 
better than valhalla,. slightly tactical, so you cant simply button smash . You wont feel like a super hero or god , like in odyssey and valhalla. Character is vulnerable , there is lot of variety.

ENVIRONMENT - Simply gorgeous. Its very much bigger than Ghost of Tsushima, Tons of areas to explore, you will get lost in the beauty

VOICE Acting and STORY - VERY VERY GOOD. I am very happy to see that its full fledged story. I am hooked with NAOE's past  , her struggle. Yet to play as Yasuke. Very excited to see his story to unfold.

ENEMY variety and NPC's - Good Enough. Not much innovation here. But good enough to keep the game fun.

GRAPHICS - OMG good. I love it.

This will be a game to play for a long time, i am pretty sure i will have more than 50 hours in it . 

If you want to rush and finish it off like most reviewers , there is a chance u might feel repetitive, but not to the extent of Origin to valhalla.

If you are into anything ""Japan"", stealth, good story, or action-adventure, then this is a no-brainer. Origins and Black Flag have been my fav.

I heard about the bad press around the game but i wanted to try it out for myself but i cant recommend it at this point maybe if they do an update soon i'll change my mind.

Edit:
After uninstalling and re-installing the game to my SSD, and making MANY changes to settings. its running better still getting render issues some times but its playable now. I have to say its okay the game itself is not adding anything new to the franchise reminds me of the last 3 games to come out but as an anime fan i love running around feudal Japan so that's a win for me. 

Pros:
- the game play is solid so far
- story is good not great
- the world is nice to look at 
-the NPC's (after changing the audio to Japanese really helps with the immersion) 

Cons:
- the dodging can get wonky from time to time (ill hit the dodge button but no dodge will happen)
- the game is resourse heavy (gonna need a higher end comp to play it and an SSD)
- nothing new really added

Overall great game, the stealth, parkour, world and characters are really interesting.

The story is pretty good nothing special but still enjoyable, there is also a lot of side content which we make the game replayability more enjoyable, the graphics are great don't even need max graphics to enjoy the beauty of the game.

Now onto what ubisoft could have done in my opinion that weird battle-pass is cool but unnecessary and its completely free (which is great) however because of this hate train going on people will use that as a reason to hate on this game i'd personally never have added that, second i am big person when it comes to following tradition, yes Yasuke is a real person but for the sake of pleasing the sad little racists i think they should have just kept it to Japanese main characters, but in my opinion i think Yasuke is such a great character, another thing expect bugs guys its game if you have one minor bug don't say the game is bad, and to people comparing Shadows to Tsushima get a life Jesus, both are good and bad in there own right (Tsushima is my favorite PS game)

Oh geez. This has been something. I only keep playing it because I didn't refund it and I kind of want my money worth and also see what the ending is. (still not there yet) But i have come pretty far into the story and man I can't care a FUCKING DAMN about the characters. Soooo poor character writing that its laughable. 
[h3]Yasuke problem...[/h3]
They also have these awkward moments between Naoe and Yasukeeeeee. I don't like Yasuke at all really. He just there... Ye just there. Why is he there? Idk. He don't improve the story at all. I wish now that they just cut out Yasuke and only focused on Naoe. If they focused on only making Naoe think about ALL the cool weapons and tools she could use then? Claw hands maybe to climb stone walls? Maybe as weapon? Hand combat? Idk. Just why didn't they only make Naoe, I think the game could have been so much better. And to go back on the Awkward moments, sometimes they laugh at stupid stuff or you can see the devs trying to make like a friendship between them and it feels sooooo forced. And they randomly laugh or make a joke and then never to be seen again. And also sometimes Yasuke just teleport in to a random cutscene like he is stalking Naoe. Like I go to a mission by myself and then POOF he shows up like he was right behind me.
[h3]DLSS?[/h3]
GUESS WHAT. The bug I complained about when the game came out about DLSS not working 50% of the time. [b]STILL NOT FIXED! [/b]I can't believe it.... Like why is there no hotfix? And enemies not dying... also not fixed... And sometimes Naoe katana sheet is not showing up? Not fixed also. Nothing is fixed. They Haven't fixed anything since my first review. Holy fuck....
[h3]Gameplay after 40h?[/h3]
Its still just mid. And the story isn't helping either. The story just making it worse. I enjoy the stealth combat but I'm starting to get to the point where I just wish they made a ""Assassin's creed"" game and cut out Yasuke so they could focus MORE on Naoe. Because her gameplay is actually fun but is getting a bit boring now days because after even 10 hours you have done most things. And after 40h you have 100000% done everything. Nothing new happens after this and its just brain dead playing it. 
I wish i got my money back :)


[h2](OLD: First 10 hours of playing)[/h2]
Honestly, just very mid. I was expecting more when I got this game with even all these delays and everything. 


Its a working game and all. Not many bugs, except the super annoying DLSS bug where the option for it just isn't there half of the time. Was hoping for a day 1 fix or day 2 fix? but nope. Like geez just hotfix it.


Gameplay is kind of eh. Assassin people is probably the most fun I'm having. The fighting is meh. The movement is actually good when it works but I feel like sometimes i tell my character ""Jump here"" and she jumps to fricking Narnia and I die. I even flick my stick in the correct direction and she just don't want to go there.


Its super annoying when you try and open the option menu sometimes because it takes you to the store instead. Why even is there a store? I thought this was a singleplayer game.


Idk man, from gameplay being mid and having a store in a singleplayer game.... This game will get a negative review. Its just okay. Thats all...

190875249,english,"So I think a lot of things have been said, and will be said, and probably shall be said again. Things about people being angry about ""historically accurate black man being black and samurai makes me super mad because I'm very white and never got to do that!"" And, ""Historically accurate woman being a woman and yet still being a ninja makes me super angry because I'm a white man and not a ninja!""

I'm pretty sure that breaks down most of the toxic comments that people leave in the reviews and the discussion board. I think? It's probably a little more broad, and uses way more language than I would care to use, to make the point. But that's more or less the point, right? I'm white, I'm a man, and this game doesn't represent me. That's the base complaint, right?

Well it's not meant to represent you. I say that as a white man who deeply loves the ladies even if they don't love me back. Just to clarify where this is coming from. BUT THIS GAME IS NOT MEANT TO BE A REPRESENTATION OF WHITE POWER. Check the language, I said it. You all toxic folk want to say it but are so scared of being yourselves it's almost comical.

Also. Thus far my playing it. AC: Shadows hits all the dang points with some issues along the way, but what game doesn't have that.

So the graphics, the big boogey man lurking around the settings area of the game. Yeah. Is it as good as something like Ghosts of Tsu ...shhmmmiiigghhhaaahh? Whatever the full name is, I don't care to figure that out. You all know what it is. Answer is? No. I played Ghosts, and it was dang gorgeous. Keep in mind it was remastered to be GORGEOUS. And it hit on the head. AC: Shadows might one day be that beautiful. Maybe? I don't really care. Is it still a pretty game with some graphical glitches here and there? Sure is.

Keep in mind I'm running off some floor model, purchased from Best Buy, Alienware, Dell-shovelware, thing that is, I remind you in the same sentence, a friggen FLOOR MODEL. That is like three years old. Literally this thing has no exuse to really run anything. But screw me sideways then flip me over for the whole of the missionary opening, this clutter-box of bolts and prayers actually runs this game on -high- settings across the board.

And it's actually pretty damn .. well .. pretty. Gorgeous? Naw. But I figure if I actually had any money in this day in age I could make it super beautiful. Any of you hate on my poverty, I'd gladly accept your donations to get a better rig. I mean, right when you want to hate the fact I'm poor, well guess what? Give me money to fix it. After all, isn't that was Musk does? So musk me bruhs! Give me money and give me a better computer!

Ahem. Anyways. So not asking for all that, but anyways.

Story? Not so far into it. I know the time makes you think it is, but I leave it running and I sleep a LOT. Also, you know, cardiac thing, I have to work out a lot. Then I get really stoned. And then I play for a few hours. And I get distracted by this stuff. So like, don't take my time in account. THAT SAID. The story seems solid to me. Seems good. Chapter one is a whole lot of this and that and you gotta be an assassin blah blah blah, Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Vallhalla in a nutshell. Just mixed them up and then get funky with and we're here. So, same story, different era, a bit more interesting? I like the story, well the general level of it at least. Still kind of lazy going, ""And here's the next national cabal who is screwing everyone INCLUDING YOU!"" story line. But it's AC. So I expected it going in. Didn't you? If you didn't .. well then you must have voted for Trump because you brain is as smooth as glass.

So how is gameplay? Eh. I'd say if you played AC: Odyssey then you got this in the bag. The ninja plays like an assassin, everyone surprised by that raise their hands. Trump supporters keep those hands up, since ya'll seemed surprised by the sun rising and the fact the moon is real. Everyone else, you can put your hands down, I forgive you. But. Seriously, if you played AC: Odyssey you got this. The combat system is loose like AC: Ody, tighter than AC: Origins, and a bit more honed than AC: Val. I disregard other Assassin Creed titles as they sit in their own realm that gears towards the OG of AC games and this does not do that. At all.

Story wise? I like it. Expect to play as a lady for the first chapter. After that we'll see. The voice acting is top notch in my opinion. Also if you disagree with me you are wrong and should burn a thousand deaths because, well, I'm right. And you're an idiot if you disagree. Seriously, the narrative is enjoyable, the acting for said narrative is enjoyable.

The game is enjoyable.

Is it game of the year?

Well no.

At least not, well, yet.

There is a lot of ""year"" to be considered here.

To put it against the last game I played through, being Kingdom Come: Deliverance II ... well frankly I dunno. I mean, my Henry was pretty rockstar and go eff yourself. I don't think I'll get that in this. But even still, man, if AC: Shadows isn't a nice drink of cold water after that I dunno what is. Maybe some Henry brewed moonshine. Mmmh, drunkenness is next to Godliness. I like where my lazy playing of this game is going.

I like the story.
I like the combat.
I like the movement.
The costuming.
The gear.
The exploration.
The absolute stupidity of it all.
I like this game.

It FEELS like a game. It FEELS like something that I can fun with. And it most importantly is FUN to play.

190874705,english,"I’ve played every Assassin’s Creed game Ubisoft has released, and I firmly believe this one stands out as one of their finest creations. Don’t let content creators try to downplay the game’s options; while the content can be diverse (no more than any other game in recent years), it’s all about choice, just like Odyssey and Valhalla. The positives far outweigh any negatives.

However, I’ve noticed some content creators are now nitpicking just to gain views.

The game’s protagonists possess a variety of well-executed skills, and while it may feel like a grind at first, it’s worth it once you unlock the abilities.

My only real gripe was the inclusion of a map for knowledge point locations. I felt obligated to purchase it using a 1000 Helix credit to progress my character later in the game, which shortened the grind. But there are so many of these locations that it’s not a significant issue if you enjoy exploration.

The fighting and stealth mechanics are what I expected and found enjoyable, and they didn’t become repetitive because there are multiple ways to play the game.

The parkour system makes sense because Naoe is a ninja Shinobi, so she’s light and agile, allowing her to scale buildings with her grappling hook and use stealth and speed.

Then there’s Yasuke, a brute samurai who relies on power and strength.

Regarding the complaints about historical inaccuracy, it’s important to remember that this is just another game like any other. Assassins and Templars are fictional characters, so your argument is invalid. It’s as close to history as Jurassic Park, which is perfectly acceptable to me since I’m enjoying the game.

This game isn’t another Souls-like game, which I’m growing tired of.

The optimisation is excellent. I’ve installed it on multiple devices and I haven’t encountered any gameplay issues, unlike many other games released lately. 

I hope the game receives the recognition it deserves because it would be a shame to see the end of a franchise that’s starting to regain its interest.",True,0,0,1742635237,76561199086917194,1610

190874268,english,"The overall gameplay, graphics and functionality are the best I have seen in the AC series, and I'm having a lot of fun with this game. 

You're going to have to grit your teeth through the prologue which is pretty poor for my taste. Some 'would be' emotional moments are spoiled by needless '5 seconds of pressing 'W' to crawl to your father' before cutscene resumes' then another 5 seconds of walking forwards before another cutscene resumes... (pointless). I don't really feel invested in the characters story yet and the introduction of 'the bad guys' was like a weird Asian, Wild West, Batman Villian movie scene all mashed together. It comes across as a bit 'not serious which spoiled the tone of the intro.

Once you get past that, the game is incredibly fun to play and the open world is very beautiful and traversible. You'll come across castles and temples with so much to do, I'm spending more than an hour in each and loving every moment of it. The animations in stealth from crawling around under buildings and pulling parkour moves across roofs and walls all the way to grappling hook climbing up castles looks very smooth and I barely even see a foot levitating above the surface anymore.

The amount of new additions to the game in terms of weaponry and abilities is also very welcome. Breathing under shallow water through a reed as part of a stealth approach took me by surprise, and you can extinguish candles at night to move around in darkness. It really feels like the stealthy AC game I was always looking to play.

190872799,english,"Unfortunately, Assassin's Creed Shadows is yet another disappointing example of Ubisoft's misguided approach to player experience. The very first issue arises before you even get to the gameplay: launching the game is impossible without Ubisoft Connect, intrusive additional app. To be honest, I wanted to finish the walkthrough at this point.

Once you finally overcome these piece of *art, you're met with gameplay that feels disappointingly recycled and lacking of soul. Despite impressive visuals, the core mechanics are tired repetitions of previous installments. The narrative itself lacks depth and the open-world aspect feels empty and uninspired.

Don't be fooled by this funny paid-for reviews. A number of the suspiciously lavish comments on first days appear out of context for actual player experience. I would advise potential players to steer clear and check a real feedback from reputable sources.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undermined by clumsy platform convergence, uninspired gameplay, and dubious marketing tactics. Unless Ubisoft radically retools its approach, I would strongly urge you to avoid playing this game.",False,0,0,1742633209,76561198285930400,16
190872506,english,Do not listen to hate its a good game. But my opinion can be clouded because i love a AC series,True,0,0,1742632883,76561198133265301,4581
190872455,english,"!The review is written at the beginning of the game. I may change it over time, or add new thoughts!

Seeing the number of active players, we can confidently say that Ubisoft's last hope was lost. 

I've loved the AC series since I was a kid. Whether it's beautiful Florence and its incredibly well thought out parkour locations in Ezio's heartwarming story, the vast waters of the Caribbean Sea with some of the best naval combat in Edward's daring story, or the tightly populated Paris and its fluidity in Arno's story. And because of that, I wanted to hope to the last minute that Ubisoft would come to their senses and stop ruining the franchise. After Syndicate, with each new installment of the series I thought: “It can't get any worse”, and Ubisoft always surprised me. 

AC:Shadows evokes a very ambivalent feeling. 

1. On the one hand, gameplay side, it's a step in the right direction. After the heavy and slow gameplay for, more like warriors than assassins, the gameplay for Naoe feels smooth as butter. Smooth and quick animations, fast movement speeds, and cool additions in stealth mechanics. For the first time in the last few installments of the series, I started to enjoy stealth. 

- Overall smoothness of the gameplay is higly appreciated. Valhalla felt so jagged and slow that it was painful to play. Considering that parkour has long since turned into “hit the button to get anywhere”, grappling hook seems like more of a nice addition. (+)
- The introduction of SHADOWS as a mechanic is incredibly cool. I'm surprised Ubisoft didn't implement this earlier. It deepens the stealth experience considerably. The same can be said for being able to lay down in the grass, or lying down to crawl somewhere. Perhaps Ubi were inspired by TLOU2(or not). Combined, this makes stealth way more fun. (+)
- The combat makes it feel like it's a mix of combat from the older parts of the series with the newer ones. In a way, it's a complete copy of Tsushima. There is a lot more emphasis on parries and counter here. And it's quite fun, especially on the high difficulty. (+)
- Base building seems redundant to me, but it doesn't hinder gameplay either. There will probably be people who will build incredibly beautiful mansions in this editor. (/)
- The RPG mechanics are still there to ruin the day, though. Endless stats, levels, items, and the rest of the garbage that I don't think AC needs at all. (-)
- Once again, microtransactions in a single-player game. Do i really need to say anything? Ubisoft, come on! (-)

2. But the story itself and the “message” of it from the very beginning spoil the whole impression of the game. Ubisoft at this point doesn't know where else to shove “inclusivity”. It's no longer so much a story as blatant propaganda. Granted, I've only just started going through the game, but the prologue alone already dumps a ton of this stuff on you. 

- Ubisoft is actively pushing an alternate history that is simply not necessary and overall stupid.
They felt a strong need to turn an ordinary African slave, which Nobunaga took possession of purely for the entertainment, into the strongest samurai, a favorite of Nabunaga, in whom he immediately sees a legendary warrior, almost the savior of Japan, and who even have an affair with Nobunaga's sister. While both him and Naoe, of course, have a capability to be LGBT.
Please, Ubi, If you're going to include a character alien to the setting, at least do it properly. (-)
- Overall story starts out extremely boring, without any interesting plot developments. It's just another AC game from the last ten years, you complete it and instantly forget the story. (-)
- The characters are as empty as the story itself. None of the previously mentioned Arno, Ezio or Edward are worth dreaming about. They are just another Alexioses and Eivars. (-)

3. But in terms of visuals and world design, Ubisoft did not disappoint as usual. The graphics looks beautiful and the world itself fascinates with its views. Except that the technical part is very disappointing. 

- The new version of the engine really shows a huge leap. The game justifies the title of “next gen” and almost reaches the unrivaled RDR2 (game released in 2018, God bless Rockstar). From the dynamic lighting to the gorgeous vegetation, graphics in this game are absolutely amazing. (+)
- Open world is not that big, but it's densely packed with unique locations and beautiful views. I would say, that it is way more beautiful, than the world of Tsushima. I actually enjoyed just walking around. It's the only thing that Ubisoft hasn't fucked up in recent years. (+)
- Optimization. Game works like shit. Without frame generation, 4090+i9 13900k - 70fps in 2k on max settings, dips to 50 included. At this point just spell out “NASA supercomputer” in the system requirements. I haven't particularly encountered any severe bugs, but the game's overall performance is just abysmal. Whoever locked the cutscenes at 30 frames deserves a special place in hell. (-)

Anyway, those are my initial thoughts on the game. Frankly, I rather liked it than not. Perhaps of all the RPG AC games - this one is the best. Maybe this game will mark the rebirth of Ubisoft, so Hexe and Black Flag Remake will turn out to be really good games. Or, the failure of this game will finally mark the death of Ubisoft as an independent studio. I guess we'll see.

However, I’m genuinely impressed by how this game has turned things around for me in terms of gameplay and the story.

First off, the gameplay is fantastic. It’s everything I loved about the earlier games in the series but with a fresh and refined approach. The parkour feels fluid, the stealth mechanics are satisfying, and the combat is smooth yet challenging. The new mechanics are well-implemented and add depth without overwhelming you. I was able to sink hours into the game, just enjoying the freedom of exploration and the thrill of sneaking through crowded streets or scaling towering buildings.

The story also stands out as one of the strongest in the series in recent years. It has a compelling narrative that keeps you hooked, with intriguing twists and a well-developed protagonist. The setting is rich, and the world-building is top-notch. The connections to the lore of the series are well-executed, and the plot moves at a solid pace, ensuring you're always engaged. It’s a huge improvement from some of the more forgettable narratives we've seen in recent entries.

That said, the English/Immersive voice acting is absolutely terrible. It feels jarring and out of place compared to the quality of the other elements. Characters who should be exuding emotion often sound flat or unconvincing, which detracts from what could be a more immersive experience. There’s no denying that this aspect of the game is a real letdown, and it’s surprising given how well other parts of the production have been handled.

There is a lot to do with repeat missions feeling a bit different in different seasons which is nice and the castles are amazing to find your way through. My favorit part so far is just walking around in the world and enjoying the scenery and sounds with an occasional killing of enemy bases. 
70 euro is of course a hefty price but that´s nothing new with the ass creed games.  

I´ve only noticed one bug so far which is that sometimes when you assassinate an enemy he gets up but then you can just push the button again and they stay dead. Happened 2times to me so it´s not that bad.

190867355,english,"Assassin’s Creed Shadows: A Next-Gen Masterpiece

Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a truly next-gen game, standing toe-to-toe with Red Dead Redemption 2 in many aspects. The game’s immersion is unparalleled, even when performing repetitive tasks. After all, repetition is a natural part of gaming, but Shadows ensures it never feels tedious.

Graphics & Visuals
The graphics are impressive, though there’s room for improvement. Some lighting effects are stunning, while others feel mediocre. Character textures are inconsistent—Yasuke’s skin looks fantastic, but Naoe’s appears somewhat cartoonish, with some NPCs even having better skin textures. Facial animations also need more refinement to enhance emotional depth. Additionally, the sprint animation, particularly for horseback riding, could use some polish.

Gameplay & Immersion
The world feels alive, but adding hunting mechanics and the ability to kill wildlife would further enrich the experience. One immersion-breaking aspect is how Yasuke or Naoe suddenly appears during certain interactions. A simple fix could be having the unselected protagonist say something like, ""I'll be watching—call if you need me."" This would make their presence feel more natural.

Final Thoughts
Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivers an incredible experience, pushing the boundaries of immersion in open-world games. While it already stands as one of the best in its genre, refining certain mechanics, animations, and lighting would elevate it even further.

After 50 hours of gameplay, I’m updating my review. The story is good, but a few aspects detract from the experience—mainly the writing and voice acting.

Despite these flaws, I still highly recommend the game, as it’s a ton of fun. It finally feels like a step toward rebuilding the broken trust with Ubisoft. I hope they continue to invest time and money into improving it even further.",True,0,0,1742626577,76561198273114504,5140

190866395,english,"I'm loving this game so far.  Brings back real life good memories.  There is a moment near the beginning of the story where the music comes together with a specific scene and I felt like I was one of the Seven Samurai as the mood changed.  From the tone of the music, to the bad guys and I was just like, Wow! I love this. I feel like I one of those Samurai from a great movie from my childhood!

I'm assuming the voice actor for Naoe is not a native English speaker.  Which brought back memories of Japan.  I've noticed some people think her character is stiff in reviews.  But honestly for myself she feels Japanese to me.  Got news for you the way the Japanese speak and intonation is stiff.  It's how it feels in real life from my experience except she is speaking English.  They don't have that intonation and nuance like we do in the Romance languages where emotion is highly present.  The Japanese language and the way they communicate at least in my experience is very mechanical in nature with minimal emotional tone.  It's the nature of the language and culture.  You can always switch to the actual Japanese version if you can handle subtitles which may ground it different way for you.

I've been loving this game so far.  It also brings back that feel of the first time I booted up Assassins Creed Odyssey and was like wow.  This is awesome and fun.  And Matsu reminded me so much of my grandmother with her spunky nature.  Didn't ever think a game would remind me of my grandma that has passed on.

For me I feel like I get to play one of the Seven Samurai shinobi style.  And the stealth is a real kick on top.  I have it up on max difficulty and it is a challenge.  Feels way more realistic and grounded than past titles.  Even the climbing more grounded unlike Odyssey where you could climb anything anywhere.  It feels less arcade action and more deliberate strategy almost like old Tenchu at night going though castles and trying to be silent while hunting your target.  I raided one of the castles after the fact and it felt very much like Tenchu from back in the day.

Also there are times that Odyssey Assassin Creed music theme shows up extremely subtly underneath the Japanese style and it gives me chills.  I don't know who did their music but damn.  They really nailed that feeling for me and they take risks mixing it up that yielded that cowboy Seven Samurai vibe.

This may end up being my favorite one of the series at this rate.  Really having a blast.

I'm further in now with more of the story.  And I am loving it.  But I enjoyed Japanese history.  This is an awesome play on the history of this time period.  For people whining about the story it is grounded in actual real life events and it so awesome to see them realized in a fictional place but with the pieces around them to fit actual history.  I really can't think of any modern games besides Kingdom Come that have tried to do this and it is very enjoyable at least for myself.  

Also there are times that the music shifts to that sort of cowboy Japanese mix and it feels so much like the Seven Samurai I love it.",True,0,0,1742625432,76561197987059630,2589

 - AC Shadows is seemingly becoming a hub for past and future AC Games (Like the Call of Duty HQ)
 - Inconsistent Climbing Mechanics (When jumping towards a flat grabbable surface, your character will sometimes not grab onto any surface and plummet to the ground)
 - Customization at the hideout can ruin cutscenes. *SPOILERS* (When Junjiro ran away, a majority of the cutscene that played was spent staring at a wall because I placed a building there)
 - Inconsistent Assassination Mechanics (When going for an assassination, the hidden blade can sometimes deal 0 damage to the enemy, causing you to get caught and forced into combat, or prompting you to try again before the death animation finishes)

190863974,english,"8/10 experience so far

Man, I’ve been waiting for an Assassin’s Creed game set in Feudal Japan for what feels like forever, and now that Shadows is finally here, I can say it absolutely delivers… at least in all the ways I expected. The world is gorgeous, the combat feels better than ever, and there’s a ton to explore. I’m having a blast sneaking around castles, getting into duels, and just soaking in the atmosphere. But at the same time, it’s still very much an Assassin’s Creed game—if you’ve played the last few, you’ll know exactly what you’re getting. Nothing super new or groundbreaking, but still a really fun time.

Japan Was 100% the Right Choice
The setting is hands down my favorite part of the game. Feudal Japan is stunning, and Ubisoft really nailed the vibe. The way the sun hits the cherry blossoms, the mist rolling through the bamboo forests, the rainy nighttime assassinations—it’s all chef’s kiss. Every town, temple, and castle feels alive, and I constantly find myself going off-track just to explore. If you’re here for the world, you won’t be disappointed.

Combat Feels Great, But Nothing Crazy New
I love how combat feels in Shadows. Switching between Yasuke’s heavy samurai fighting style and Naoe’s more traditional assassin stealth is really satisfying. Yasuke’s swordplay has weight, every hit feels brutal, and when you get into duels, it’s straight-up cinematic. On the flip side, playing as Naoe makes you feel like a proper shinobi, sneaking in the shadows and using all sorts of cool tricks. That said, while the combat is definitely refined and fun, it’s not mind-blowingly different from what we’ve seen in Assassin’s Creed before. It’s an improvement, for sure, but it’s still the same basic formula.

Exploring Never Gets Old
Exploration is another highlight. There’s just so much to do—hidden shrines, secret tunnels, little villages to stumble into, and of course, a bunch of collectibles that I keep getting distracted by. Climbing castles and swimming through underground passages feels just as fun as it did in past games, and I love how vertical some of the areas are. If you enjoy getting lost in a world and finding cool stuff along the way, this game totally delivers.

Bottom Line: A Fun Assassin’s Creed Game, Nothing More, Nothing Less
At the end of the day, Shadows is exactly what I hoped for—a solid Assassin’s Creed game in Feudal Japan. It looks amazing, the combat feels good, and there’s plenty to do. But if you’re expecting some huge, game-changing leap for the series, you won’t find it here. It’s still Assassin’s Creed at its core, with all the familiar mechanics and open-world structure we’ve come to expect. And honestly? That’s totally fine by me. I’m having a great time, even if it’s nothing revolutionary.

You'll have to make up your own mind, alone. After you've done that then you can complain and follow the herd or separate and be your own being. Try to create [b]YOUR[/b] own opinion and please stop just blindly follow others when the majority of you have no idea what this game even has to offer.

I have been following Assassin's Creed Shadows since the first [url=https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906/]delay[/url] happened in september of 2024. I didn't expect anything special of the game and then the second delay happened and I didn't think anything of it. I wasn't interested. The last entry I played and enjoyed alot was [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/812140/Assassins_Creed_Odyssey/] Assassin's Creed Odyssey. [/url]

What changed my mind on this game, because I had my fair doubts was the early gameplay footage and it looked really promising. I'm [b]BIG[/b] into the stealth genre and I mean; I'm a [i]huge[/i] stealth entusiast and now after the game has been released it's more than I could've asked for:

[h3][b] THE POSITIVE: [/b][/h3]
[list]
    [*]It's an open world game, on a massive map with great intergration of perks, skills and character buildning.
    [*]The option to use stealth is there and the gameplay for it is awesome. So many ways to kill and sneak around the towns and temples. 
    [*]The parkour is fluent and looks awesome, jumping across buildings and preforming air assassinations works great. Same with combat, it flows so well and once you get ahold of it, becomes really fun.
    [*]The photomode within the game is fenomenal and with this beautiful playground of a game; that is Assassin's Creed Shadows... You can really capture some beautiful moments.
    [*] The music within the game when you idle or just move around in the world. Chills. It's beautiful. 
    [*] The game has seasons; that right! Summer, winter, authum and spring. Looks really awesome. It's not dynamic but you can toggle the seasons whenever you want and it also changes while playing and progressing the story.
    [*] The world within Assassin's Creed: Shadows feel alive with people, activities, enemies, alot of wild life and the nature just capture you. 
[/list]

[h3][b] THE NEGATIVE: [/b][/h3]
    [*] The AI within the game is just totally f*cked up, Dumb and dumber 3,0. Even though I play on the highest expert difficulty it's not really a challenge, which makes me sad. Disaster, I'm really hoping that a patch arrives that improves on this area ASAP. 
    [*]Glitches... I've had a few weird clippings within cutscenes and it just ruins the experience when you're trying to follow the story. It throws you off. 
    [*]The lipsync isn't good at all, the game itself is great and I do enjoy the story so far but playing with the native language setting, something still feels off. It's not up to the standard that I'm used to. Both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West does alot of heavy lifting in this department while Assassin's Creed: Shadows falls short. 
    [*] Alot of foliage ruins the gameplay because all you can see is leaves and branches everywhere while travelling around the game world and your character only gets outline so you can see where you are but not where you're going,  

[h3][b] MY CONCLUSION: [/b][/h3]
It's an Assassin's Creed game with a japanese setting, which I enjoy alot and that's why I bought the game and I'm having a really great time playing it. End of story and I do recommend the game because it is really well made and the gameplay is alot of fun, especially the stealth.

I'm happy for Ubisoft and I hope they sell alot of copies. Well deserved.
This purchase was a pre-order and it was my first pre-order of a game since 2014s [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/]Dying Light[/url] and the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows wasn't a total buggy catastrophe like alot of games that release today are.

190863258,english,"Assassin's Creed Shadows proposes a simple trade - you give Ubisoft 70 dollars, and Ubisoft gives you some of the most boring unoriginal gameplay you will ever experience in your life. Shadows is simply more of the same, and the areas of improvement and any positive changes do not do nearly enough to carry this game's glaring flaws.

Lets start with what the game does best: visuals. Shadows is hands down the best looking AC game to date. The seasons are all unique and look great, and the lighting is seriously impressive. From a technical standpoint the performance does suffer when maxing out graphics and really pushing the ray tracing settings but so far every area I've been to has looked incredible, with few extreme FPS drops stutters or crashes. Ubi's environment teams really do a great job when crafting worlds for many of their franchises, even beyond AC.

The stealth system has some welcome improvements. The grappling hook offers a new way to get around POIs and the lighting system/prone mechanics are also nice to have, as they allow you to really get into a completely stealthy and silent approach. Some of the perks available in the Assassin and Shinobi skill trees also add to the overall stealth experience.

The hideout system is implemented well and is more in depth than I thought it would be. I found myself actually interested in it where prior to the game's launch I assumed Id want to interact with it as little as possible.

This is where the positives of this game end. 

The gameplay, aka the only thing that truly matters in any game, is the same bland repetitive ""A Ubislop Original"" garbage we are accustomed to. Run to this map marker, kill the same 2 enemy types 24 times while spamming eagle vision and zooming in to look for glowing markers. Then collect resources for upgrades that have overinflated requirements to try to sell MTX in a 70 dollar single player game (seriously fuck off with this bullshit Ubisoft its disgusting). After you complete the POI you are in, you now get to do this 300 more times if you can handle it across a map that is once again too big because Ubisoft can, not because they should. Its boring, repetitive, and lazy. When you have artificially large worlds, you have to resort to cookie cutter boring content to fill the voids. There's 0 variation in the enemy types, 0 variation as to how to approach these POIs, and 0 real incentive to do everything unless you really want to clear a map full of markers. Its been the bane of AC's existence for a long time now, and the formula really needs to change.

[Mild spoilers ahead] The story is very generic and for Naoe is a typical revenge plot. Introduce a character we don't care about as we have just met them, kill them 10 minutes later, and watch as Naoe wants to go on a murderous rampage killing anyone and everyone involved. Very creative and original Ubi, truly groundbreaking. On the other hand, Yasuke feels very out of place gameplay wise, and shows up much later on in the story that you are so used to playing Naoe unless you want to be an overtuned and broken tank, there really is no point to playing Yasuke with his limited kit and obvious stealth disadvantages. There are many areas you cannot access with Yasuke because hes too big or too tall or whatever other excuse they set up. Disregarding all the DEI bullshit, the play style really feels out of place. Yasuke would have been much better as a side character you encounter in the game, not a playable character. This was the perfect opportunity to go the Odyssey route and let the player choose to be male or female, and take a page out of Ghost of Tsushima's book allowing them to approach the combat as an honorable Samurai or a silent Shinobi. I believe this would have allowed the combat system to be as good as Tsushima as well. The story is incredibly boring and bland, the characters are uninteresting for the most part, and while I am aware that the English voice over may be Japanese VAs speaking English, for most characters the English VA is poorly delivered, sometimes even sounding a little robotic and lifeless, almost as if certain things are lost in translation.

The game falls flat on its face with it's story, then gets up and immediately falls over itself again, and again. The cutscenes are bad, with a 30fps lock and character models in these scenes look like they were created in 2013, made worse by really bad lip syncing and stiff and sluggish animations. They simply dont look good, are immersion breaking and in my opinion not acceptable for a AAA(A?) single player story game. When your game is a single player rpg, you really only need to get 2 things right, the story and the combat, and Shadows fails in both departments. 

Combat for both characters is extremely simple and again, boring. You parry once in a while, dodge attacks that cant be deflected, and spam light or heavy attacks. There's no stances or opportunities for high skill ceiling combat, no real difficulty as even groups of enemies will only attack one by one, and the tougher enemies are actually the easiest because you just dodge then attack over and over until they are dead. The enemy AI is pretty bad as well. Playing on expert difficulty, the AI is very blind and deaf in many situations, sometimes failing to react even when looking right at me, but don't you dare peak your head over a rooftop because for that they have lock on 20/20 vision. The combat animations are good overall, but they are extremely repetitive, each enemy type has a very tiny set of animations, and the player's assassination and execution animations are also extremely repetitive and limited. Once again we get to apply Ubislop logic: instead of Naoe covering the mouth of an enemy and stabbing them in the back or the heart, she will kick them in the leg and stab them in the stomach. Not only would this not actually kill someone instantly, its noisy and the enemies will even yell or scream, which is the exact opposite of what you would want in a stealth situation, yet somehow none of the other enemies in the area hear this bullshit going down. The lack of attention to detail is another certified Ubisoft Original, as they clearly uneducated in common sense, going for things that look cool, not things that make sense or are practical. 

I could go on and on about the bad and the ugly with this game as there are plenty of other smaller instances of bad decisions, issues and poor design implementations, but its not worth the effort. This is once again another of those Ubisoft Original AAAA games that us brain dead consumers simply don't understand. We arent worthy of Ubisoft's brilliance. If you want a Samurai/Shinobi game that is better than this one in many areas. Ghost of Tsushima is the better choice. This is not a bad game to pick up for 20-25 dollars if you really want to play another AC game, just know that you are getting a lot more of the same repetitive boring slop, that is not worth anywhere close to 70 dollars. Its a solid 6 out of 10. As to where all the gaming ""journalists"" got their 8/9 and even 10/10 scores from, I have no idea. Ubisoft had a easy path to bouncing back with a setting many fans have been dreaming of for years, and they failed in almost every way possible. Maybe next time leave the political statements out of the game, and focus on creating good gameplay, not setting a world record for the number of times you could disrespect a country's culture in a single title.

190862846,english,"Dont buy above 15 dollars or play on ubisoft subscription or game pass. Not worth 70.

Its like an indie game without the dedication or polish of an indie game. PS4 or XB1 graphics so it runs okay on modern cards with frame generation. Naoe reminds me of dora the explorer or someone mentally disabled, the other guy is just kind of simple. The voice acting is rough, its a lot of that being able to tell the voice actors didnt know what tone to take to reply to things, like sounding excited when they should be serious or sad. The combat has like three animations, enemies have one or two moves so they are easily read. The story isnt interesting to me because I know they went fictional this time so while I'd like to learn some historical facts I dont know what is made up like the gay black samurai. I also dont relate to either the dora the explorer simpleton japanese girl or the gay black retainer, so if the story is mid without facts and the characters are bland and unrelateable, what is here for entertainment?

I wanted to take a break and consider if I want to keep the game or return it, its not worth 70 thats for sure. I was hoping it would be decent coming in with low expectations and am disappointed. I'd wait for a sale or if you absolutely have to play it do the stupid ubisoft subscription thing or gamepass. I feel like this would be worth 15 or so. Will update later if I end up keeping it.

Edit @ 35ish hours:
So Ive realized the character animation in cutscenes looks like it was done in gmod, where the heads stay completely still and only the mouth moves, and all of the facial expressions are jarringly bad.

Also, quit a lot of crashing, like spending 30-45 minutes clearing out a castle and it crashes right before youre done, no saving or autosaves in enemy areas, Ive likely accumulated about 10-15 hours of just redoing things again because of crashing.

parkour feels great for the first time since Unity, they FINALLY brought back the sick animations from Unity whenever you'd use the ""climb down"" button. no more jumping off every building and going into a combat roll every single time. also, the diving frontflip move you can use is sick and I hope every AC game after this uses it, dont fucking regress back to poopy parkour. KEEP IMPROVING IT, this is a good start in the right direction. stealth and combat animations look awesome too, the GORE is the best ive seen in an AC game. decapitations and blood galore. as for voice acting, im playing on ""immersion mode"" which has everyone speaking Japanese, and it sounds great to me. havent listened to the English voice acting, and honestly i dont feel the desire to.

the story about 4 hours in really isnt that bad. if you were worried about the game being a ""cringe woke"" game, that whole thing is so overblown. I had my radar up looking for signs of woke bullshit because I dont like that in my games either. but I really cant see it yet. the plot feels very grounded, and im not really thinking about the race of the characters while the plot develops. 

as for the price tag, 70$ is pretty wild no matter how good a game is. if you're on the fence, wait til it goes down to 60 or lower on a sale.

edit: after putting alot more time in I just had to add, this game world is insanely huge and theres so much to do. Im about 20 hours in and i've yet to unlock Yasuke because im getting sidetracked constantly. around this point is when I began to get tired of the previous entries like Odyssey or Valhalla. in those games, all the side content feels like an annoying chore and thats what eventually made me lose interest before i could even finish the games. but in this entry, all the side content ACTUALLY has substance to it so it doesnt feel like im just wasting my time running around. also, running around on foot feels so damn fast and fun.

Visuals are STUNNING, i've always loved visiting Japan and thoroughly enjoy their culture and so far the game depicts it so well.

As for bugs i updated my drivers prior to installing and haven't had any issues with 16gb ram and a 4060, some lighting issues noticed and some movement bugs from animals but nothing close to affecting gameplay.

Intro was a little long but the cut scenes and story are so interesting i was actually reading (playing with immersive dialogue) and felt like i was watching a movie. My only con with story so far is it's redundant but i mean i get it, gotta have one big bad guy and a bunch of other heads to hunt down. 

After getting to scratch the surface with the safehouse building and upgrading weapons and armor i really am enjoying how they are done.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute triumph! From the moment I launched the game, I was completely immersed in its stunning world. The graphics are breathtaking, with every detail meticulously crafted to bring the historical setting to life. The lighting, textures, and environmental design are next-level, making exploration an absolute joy.

The gameplay is where Shadows truly shines. The stealth mechanics are refined to perfection, offering a satisfying blend of strategy and action. Whether I was sneaking through crowded streets or scaling towering structures, every movement felt fluid and responsive. The combat system is equally impressive, with a perfect balance of challenge and reward that keeps you on your toes.

But what really sets this game apart is its story. The narrative is rich, emotional, and deeply engaging, with well-developed characters that you genuinely care about. The historical context is expertly woven into the plot, making you feel like you're part of a living, breathing world. I found myself completely invested in the protagonist's journey, and the twists and turns kept me hooked until the very end.

The attention to detail in the world-building is phenomenal. From the bustling cities to the serene countryside, every location feels authentic and alive. The side quests are meaningful and add depth to the overall experience, making it easy to lose yourself in this world for hours on end.

And let's not forget the soundtrack! The music is hauntingly beautiful, perfectly complementing the game's atmosphere and enhancing every moment of gameplay.

In short, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a must-play for any fan of the series or anyone who loves a great action-adventure game. It's a masterpiece that sets a new standard for the franchise. Ubisoft has truly outdone themselves with this one. Don't miss out on this incredible experience!

190857226,english,"As a diehard Assassin's Creed fan since I was 8 (shoutout to the memories of climbing towers in the first game like a true parkour newbie), I was skeptical about Shadows at first. But let me tell you—Ubisoft has absolutely outdone themselves this time. This game is stealthy, smooth, and downright fun. It’s like they took all the best parts of AC and then sprinkled in a bit of ninja magic.

First of all, the ability to lay down? Pure genius. I never thought I’d enjoy lying flat on my face in a video game, but here we are. The game’s stealth mechanics are on point, and now I can literally become one with the ground. My assassin might as well be part pancake, which I am 100% okay with. Who needs to hide behind barrels when you can become a human rug?

Now, the combat. Oh boy. It’s as satisfying as a well-timed blade to the back of an unsuspecting guard. Whether you’re diving into a group of enemies or quietly taking them out one by one, the combat feels fluid, powerful, and, dare I say, deliciously violent. The mix of stealth and action is a perfect combo, and it never gets old.

And here’s a big win: I’ve sunk 15 hours into this game already, and guess what? There was only one glitch. ONE. And it wasn’t even that bad—it was like the game tried to make me an unintentional ninja by warping me through a wall for a second. But hey, I’ve seen Ubisoft games launch with WAY more than one glitch, so this is practically a flawless victory in my book.

All in all, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a solid, fun entry into the series. Stealthy as a ninja, satisfying combat, and hardly any bugs to ruin the experience. If you’ve been a fan of the series for as long as I have (basically since I was old enough to run around yelling ""Eagle Vision""), this one is definitely worth checking out. And who knows?

190857107,english,"Impressions after the first day of playing: surprisingly very engaging! 😃

Like many others, after all the talk about development hell and management issues, I wasn’t expecting anything from the game… and when I watched streams, it seemed like just another Valhalla… but despite the visual similarities, it feels like a completely different game!

First of all, thank you for Naoe! Finally, after so many years, I’m playing as an assassin again, not a demigod ))) the combat has changed and I like it! Clearing outposts is pleasant and satisfying 🙂 traveling through the open world feels smooth. The various map activities are well-placed, and if you stick to the quests, they’re not too far from each other, so the distances are just right for placing natural narrative breaks.

The story feels pretty simple, but overall it’s interesting to follow its development, though for me it’s more like a thread to string the pearls of other activities on. It’s good that it exists, but by the fourth hour I’d forgotten about it and just started wandering around the map ))) I only came back to it when I stumbled into a story fortress and figured okay, time to see what happens next)))

The graphics are very nice. Finally, someone other than CDPR figured out how to use ray tracing properly. And the new DLSS works great too 👍 I’m playing on a laptop with an RTX 4070, and after a bit of tweaking I got a very nice image with 60fps at native resolution.

That’s it for now — we’ll see how it holds up after completing the game. Overall takeaway: if you’re even slightly into Assassin’s Creed, give this game a chance. After the rather controversial Vikings and Greeks, this one is a big step up))))

P.S. My impressions come from a place of love for Unity and fond memories of Syndicate. Origins was okay, but I never finished it. And Greece and Valhalla — those were very, very bad 😅 unfortunately I bought them all and even played a bit)) compared to them, Shadows is way more interesting 🤷‍♂️😄",True,0,0,1742614401,76561198099418656,1957

This game is nothing impressive.
I have not played an Assassins Creed game since Black Flag and wanted to try it out.

First what I like about the game.
-There is a lot to explore. The world is massive and after 10 hours I have seen like 50% of the first area.
-The enviourment is very beautiful. It looks amazing when you are on top of a tower and overlook the forest.
-I like the season mechanic. The look of the world changes depending on the season.
-NPC behaviour. I saw guards going inside a house to take shelter when it started to rain while covering the head from the rain.

Now to the things i don't like.
-The combat and movement/climbing is just ok and becomes old very quick.
-Animations in cutscenes look clunky and the face animations don't match the situations and dialog.
-The cutscenes are capped at 31FPS and it seems like they have less details then the live gameplay (atleast on very high settings). No game comes to mind where the cutscenes have less level of quality then the game when you play it.
-I don't like the english voice acting. At times the dialog seems forces and the tone and emotions don't fit the situation.

190855160,english,"So I’m now about six hours in. I think the delays for this game gave people a lot of ammunition for trashing it. In some cases, it seemed like people were so eager to pile on Ubisoft because of various problems they’ve been having, they have used this game as a place to dump all their frustrations and misery on. 

It’s not a masterpiece, but it feels really good and it has done everything I’ve expected of it so far and more. I’ve not run into any wild bugs or crashing. Star Wars outlaws actually crashed on me twice in a few hours I’ve been playing it.  But that could be more indicative of my overclock being slightly unstable. Shadows has been rocksolid. 

I wish people would give this game a fair chance. It’s not reinventing the wheel. I like the tweaks it has made to the assassins Creed formula. It feels more focused and methodical than Valhalla and odyssey, which seemed to just want to throw everything in with the kitchen sink. 

The comparisons between the it and Ghost of Tsushima are inevitable, but it feels very different and plays differently. It’s actually more grounded and doesn’t have any supernatural elements hardly at all. 

It’s a solid 8/10 for me right now, and could go even higher depending upon how the rest of the game plays out.",True,0,0,1742612231,76561198000007706,2125

I had to start advancing the cut scenes because 1. they were too boring and it was hurting my brain and 2. I'm trying to decide if I want a refund before Steam won't allow me to get a refund.  We all know that once you reach that 2hr mark you're screwed, and this game was ridiculously expensive.

Fighting is good, Naoe and Yasuke really felt different. She's faster, he's a tank. Fight animation is typical of a modern AC game. Nothing bombastic. Same challenges but better animation I suppose.

Story - they say felt bland but I haven't progressed that much so I have yet to see it.

Music felt weird, It's a mix of modern and traditional Japanese. The modern mix kinda throws me off of the immersion. I don't know. It might grow on me. I have always loved AC's music but the music here might be a slow burn.

Performance. Generally great. Few FPS drops on cutscenes. Probably because of my old RX6600XT. Might turn the Ray Tracing off. At launch, it really is pretty stable.

Voice acting is probably the weakest for me here. I'm playing in immersion mode and even the Japanese dub felt weak.

Overall, it's a solid 8/10 for me. I would still play the hell out of this. I would still recommend it.",True,0,0,1742607796,76561199007373112,2088

190850457,english,"Here is my hot take so far.  I know this is only days 2 or 3 if you played it early. Overall I like the game because I am really into the samurai lore and love that they adapted this into the Assassins Creed series. I have hope that it will get a lot better because I love this game series but it really hasn't started out to well. In this review I will be comparing this to Odyssey.

From what I have seen so far...... 4 stars or high 3 stars

Honestly the map size is quite sad. Especially when you get a lot of spots that aren't on the trail that are inaccessible  because of ""mountainous and steep terrain"" ...... like seriously. I hope the map opens up more because its quite sad not to be able to explore and ""find your own way"" as the game states for the recommended difficulty. Like now I have to follow a bunch of trails to find where the trail is. 

Now what I think is also disappointing is the fact you cant kill the animals. I understand its not ""humane"" in this day in age (which doesn't make sense seeing as it is a game about murdering a bunch of people) but they seriously limited the hunt aspect and the opportunity for legendary beasts or even hunt missions.

Something else I noticed was that when talking to people about getting information on the map they don't say a word. Like you were seriously too lazy to put in a few lines about stuff like of I know of a cosmetic merchant located here or I heard a rumor about a butterfly collector in Katano. 

Some bugs I have noticed so far is that when there is someone laying down asleep and you go to assassinate them they don't die. The just stand up and if you don't assassinate them fast they will see you and take you out of stealth. As well as when I hit someone off a ledge they don't take fall damage. Like a broke some guys guard and he had a sliver of health. Fell down a 15 foot drop onto his back and survived. Like seriously. NO DAMAGE!?!?!

Something I have noticed as well especially comparing it to Odyssey is the combat in this game is so much harder, you die so much quicker and you are almost always surrounded some how. It also has been pretty hard to get distance from your target without rolling away like a ball. 

Something I have seen others talk about is that they took stuff from Ghost of Tsushima and made it worse. and honestly so far I would agree. Ghost of Tsushima had a lot of tests that used your memories and reaction skills for puzzles and so far I have seen a really dumbed down version of this. 

There are other things I could talk about but I don't want to get ahead of myself so I will leave it at that.

190849006,english,"Just to have some context, last AC game that I have played was Unity, last that I have finished was Rogue. TL;DR version at the bottom.

Seeing the positive reviews I decided to give this game a chance. Some quick points to start: you have to restart the game to apply graphic settings in 2025. And prologue is long enough for you to miss your chance to refund this game. First 20 minutes or so felt completely out of place. You start as a Samurai Yasuke kill some dudes, and get no further mention of that in the next 3 hours (maybe more, I have not played more yet). Then you start to play as Shinobi Naoe and get cutscenes after cutscenes that also have flashbacks to literally 10 minutes ago. All of that just feels wrong like they actually wanted to stretch the time you need to get to the actual gameplay.

The next thing that I noticed is music, first you watch a sad cutscene and a second after that you hear battle drums with 0 enemies around you, 5 minutes later another sad cutscene, you're crippled trying to get up and run away and you hear the same battle drums, still no enemies in sight.

After that I saw a cutscene straight from an action movie while listening to something close to J-Rock and a ""boss fight"" right after that. At that point I have completely lost any hope, my immersion was gone and the game was starting to feel like a joke. Completely clueless AI with zero vision cone and range on Expert difficulty. You can swing on a rope in front of them and they won't see a thing.

Battle pass in a single player game as well as a microtransaction shop. Sure I can ignore that and I don't have to use it. But still.. Why? At least I knew about that part beforehand.

A brief summary of combat: you mash attack button, you dodge or parry, use heavy attack and if the enemy is the same level as you then he will die. If he is higher you'll have to repeat that 10 times. It's not challenging, it doesn't reward you and it is boring af.

Climbing is okay I guess, but what felt wrong is how I felt forced to go through certain routes. It felt like there is no alternatives. No point in going other ways than those carefully handcrafted paths, that require zero brain activity, run, assassinate, run, assassinate, done.

[b]EDIT1[/b]: Oh, and something I remembered, when I saw a button to auto-follow NPC I was happy. But after that when I got to gameplay and had to travel 2000m I realized that there is no button to auto-follow a road on a horse. Not even a hold button to auto-follow a road. You actually have to hold Shift+W and turn with a mouse, no looking around, no nothing. I feel like that feature is an industry standart from Witcher 3 if not earlier yet somehow it is missing here. I'm pretty sure even AC:Origins have that, but they forgot to include that here.

[b]EDIT2[/b]: After playing for 15 hours I'll say this. It's a AA game for a AAA price. There are a lot of small things that just not thought of. Is it a good game? I would say it's an okay game, it has some things. Is it a good AC game? Definitely not. You're a shinobi caught up in a war, you kill people because quest giver said so.

[b]TL;DR[/b]: If you have a beer in one hand, gamepad in another and don't want to think at all then I guess it is a good game. You mash attack, you run in direction of white and yellow paint press F to kill enemies, loot stuff. Not fun for me tho.",False,0,0,1742605444,76561198064340976,2212

However..... This is the first game where they've modeled a protagonist after a real historical figure, and yet they felt the need to give me dialogue options for him to romance a royal bloodline? That seems..... wrong. If you're going to use an actual historical figure, stick to history. 

Another thing that drove me crazy about this game is the ""busy"" mechanics. Using scouts to uncover the map, while a cool concept that I can vibe with, serves no purpose and provides no value.

I change my mind after 40 hrs im tired of this sht story doesn't want end yet nothing is happening in it, the abilities and weapons in this game are cool but It takes so long to get the points to aquire them and even when you get them they're just flashy without purpose. the combat system is just bland, there are different enemy types but it doesn't matter that they're different bcs you take them all on the same way, any way. 

The stealth mechanics r great but level design is so poor that its easy even on the hardest diff. and after many stealth infiltrations u realise that everytime you're applying the same strategies.

Story is whatever, I skip through half of it anyways, lol. Games almost always have pretty generic stories so I don't know what people want here. Plus if you switch to Japanese dialogue it helps with some of the bad acting.

190843038,english,"After dumping 4 hours into cutscenes at the start of the game, the remaining 4 hours of gameplay (After all that), has been somewhat interesting.

Assassins Creed Shadows takes on a strong RPG approach much like Valhalla, yet doesn't use the same formula to the T.
The combat compared to Valhalla doesn't feel Weighty, though it fits with the whole Ninja theme of it (No, 8 hours in, I have not had access to the Samurai.).

However Valhalla's weighty approach to weapons made combat feel fulfilling, in Shadows, it doesn't quite catch that mark.
The new Hideout system is fun, especially with the critters you can collect along the way, and the paintings you can hang up, that is a A+ to whoever made that happen, and deserves a pat on the back, however whoever was in charge of the story intro, only 1 thing should be said. Don't kill a character off before making them feel important. Seeing a character die doesn't invoke feelings just because there is a dramatic moment, it requires build up, to make the player's attached to them. There is 1 instance where the Backstory should have been used before the present day issue, which would have made a more convincing death. So death #1 felt extremely wasted and I only enjoyed the character AFTER they were already gone, with no attachment to their end.

The weapon system is interesting, having skill sets dedicated to your weapons, though having run through Valhalla, it feels like a very small pool. Understandably considering how much effort went into the skill trees, but even so, feels like the skill trees could have been a little less focused to allow more variety, especially since we are now running 2 characters who can only use their selected weapon classes.

So far, Shadows has felt like a very aggressive mix of new and old mechanics, while not really getting those mechanics done 100%.

Shadows doesn't feel like a good game, but it also doesn't feel like a bad game. This is where I with I could give a ""Middle"" Recommendation, as it really sits there in the series. Having played all but Mirage in the series since I was a kid, Shadows feels like it doesn't accel, but it also doesn't fail. It is a interesting project, and hope they can turn this around to have more aimed content. If Valhalla is any indication, I know that Ubisoft, and the team, are able to make great things with this series, so I look forward to how that turns out over the next few years.

A major point is that the Story Telling is very well done, I feel like I am sucked into the lore with each cutcscene, yet there in itself lies a problem, I play Assassins Creed for the Balance of Game play and Storytelling,which so far has not been the case. I hope that the further into the game I get, the more balanced it becomes, but with 8H into the game, it feels extremely story based right now.

It would also be nice to see more finishing moves on weapons. With how few of them there are, it would be refreshing.

Lastly from a Quality of life standpoint, it would be nice if you went into crouch after knocking someone out with a strangle if you are standing in a tall bush. It would help a lot and make sense, considering that we no longer yank an enemy back to the bushes to assassinate them now. Instead we just jump out of the brush and kill them in the open, which doesn't feel very smart compared to past entries where we yank them into the bush, then kill them so that we remain hidden.",True,0,0,1742599079,76561198091993338,2971

This game faced a lot of backlash over just about everything, so I expected the worst, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. It’s actually very good.

The cutscenes are stunning, the combat is dynamic, responsive, and can be quite punishing depending on your difficulty level. The story is intriguing, and honestly, Yasuke is a fantastic addition. Some people want to make a big deal out of DEI, but let’s be real, one of the coolest aspects of the game is the massive height difference between Naoe and Yasuke. It completely changes how you experience the game… literally! Besides, Yasuke in full armor looks badass. 

On top of that, I’m genuinely excited to see where the story goes and how both characters progress. There’s so much potential, and I can’t wait to dive deeper into their arcs.

Visually, the graphics are very good, and I’m genuinely surprised that a Ubisoft game actually runs well for once. The optimization is… shockingly decent!

The base building is also very nice and a refreshing addition to the game. There is a lot of customization. I just wish there were more buildings to choose from...haha.

190841667,english,"I am on the fence with this game, but must ultimately give it a thumbs down. It has a few good things going for it, but it is a big missed opportunity compared to what it could be. The hefty price tag and the fact that I recently played KCD2 and saw how immersive games can be shifted my opinion towards a “not recommended”. Anyway, here is a brief summary of what I like and not.

The good:
1.	The game looks beautiful. The gorgeous vistas, improved faces, beautiful rivers and changing seasons look great, as does the lighting. The art style of the UI is also gorgeous, and a good homage to Japanese traditions of painting.
2.	Naoe is a compelling character with interesting new tools and fighting styles. And I like Yasuke too, they are different enough to allow for two distinct gaming experiences in one game. While this has been criticized, I think it is a cool idea, though I could have also been happy with a good-at-fighting assassin like Bayek.
3.	The hideout mechanic is really cool.
4.	The setting. I really love Japan in all shapes and sizes, and was looking forward to this for quite a while.
5.	The good combat is matched by a decent combat UI, prompts and other support mechanics that make fighting feel fluid.

The bad:
1.	The world feels fake somehow, like a backdrop. Comparing it to Origins (IMO the best AC open world), the world does not feel lived in. There are a few things that are poorly done. Huge numbers of NPCs literally standing about doing basically nothing. Also, the number of animals is 3-4 times what it should be. Deer, tanuki and rabbits constantly get in your way or run in front of your horse. In real life even a zoo enclosure has a smaller animal population density. The world is also not that interactive.You enter people's homes to take things and they just stay around doing nothing.
2.	While I thought the outrage overblow, Yasuke’s intro and the hip hop combat music make it seem like the game was geared towards 2021 US political sensitivities, not a depiction of 1579 Japan.
3.	The writing and story remain poor, leading to forgettable characters, abrupt changes in attitude and the like. There are games such as KCD2 with less than stellar stories, hit and miss voice acting and other issues that STILL manage to wow me by their gorgeous writing and immense talent of their lead voice actors alone. This is not the case here, even if the Japanese voiceovers are fairly good.
4.	The game feels somewhat clunky to me. Not necessarily in terms of control, but in terms of the link between gameplay, controls and mechanics.
5.	Even in the early game, I get the feeling that busywork is heavily present. Wish there would have been less of it.",False,0,1,1742597707,76561198122632662,463

Why am I not recommending it then? Because I genuinely have no clue what Ubisoft was smoking while making it.
The sword fighting is painful to look at when you come from something like Kingdom Come Deliverance and have spent time on the swordfighting side of youtube. The combat genuinely looks like something a 14 year olds oc would be doing to look cool.
Next up is the faces, they are absolutely hilarious. Sometimes I wonder if they forgot to move them during cutscenes only to be hit by eyebrows when the sentence is over. And not when it is appropriate either.
My favorite part so far is during a cutscene where the voice actor just gets right up to the microphone and breathes heavily into it. I lost it completely during an otherwise emotional scene.

190840457,english,"Overall, I'm going to keep playing the game because I want it to get better, however, it isn't. The latest coding goof that I have come across is Naoe won't get knocked off a parapet. She'll get knocked down sure, but then gets right back up and even moves back onto the ledge that was she on before I missed getting hit by an NPC. I will say that the graphics are great though. I'm glad the story line isn't what we were led to believe based on the trailers. However, playing as Naoe is more difficult than it needs to be. She's the ninja with assassin skills, not really sword-fighting skills. And yet, the game puts you in ""boss battles"" frequently as Naoe. So, you better be REALLY good at fighting or get used to loading the last checkpoint and trying over and over. I do really like having to use the trails to get around Japan rather than just running wherever you want. This gives the game a more realistic feeling of what it was like in feudal Japan. Overall, for an AC game, I like that this has its own feel and but also how certain things have returned, i.e. throwing knives reminescient of the OG AC, building up a hideout like in ACIII and Black Flag, as well as using scouts like in Brotherhood. However, the constant reloading and having to fight stronger characters in boss battles and throughout the game map is very frustrating, enough for me NOT to recommend this game to others.",False,0,0,1742596564,76561199151460015,2774

I'm a pretty easy girl to please: Let me walk around Sengoku Japan as a samurai, slashing and hacking bad guys apart and I'm happy. This game gives me just that so I'm happy.

I will say though that the beginning of the game was a little rough for me personally because it locks you into playing the Shinobi Stealth character Naoe for a while until you unlock the Samurai character Yasuke. Naoe isn't a bad character, she's cool but I'm not the biggest fan of her playstyle, which is very stealth focused. Naoe can't take a lot of damage so she really struggles fighting groups of enemies.

Which is against my personal preferred playstyle: fighting lots of bad guys and engaging with the games combat system.

Now that I got Yasuke unlocked though... Oh boy is this game fun.

The game is extremely beautiful. I'm not a very cultured person, so seeing stuff like this is just absolutely amazing. (even if it's not a 1 for 1 comparison of actual japanese culture) The wind mechanic is very well done, and combat feels so freaking good.

The 16th-century Japan setting is incredible, the gameplay feels smooth, and the combination of Yasuke and Naoe adds a variety I haven’t seen in the series for a long time. Stealth is more dynamic, combat has weight, and the exploration has hooked me from the very first minute.

For me, this is the best Assassin’s Creed Ubisoft has made since Origins. After that game, the company went downhill, with entries that felt increasingly generic and soulless. Shadows has brought back that feeling of being in a living, well-designed world with polished mechanics. It’s not perfect, but so far, I’m really enjoying it. If Ubisoft keeps going in this direction, they might regain the greatness they lost years ago.

I really hope Ubisoft doesn’t have to shut down.

190835661,english,"I'm about 14 hours in, and I just eliminated my first major assassination target (no spoilers). This slow speed is not because of any pacing issues. It's because there's just a lot of side areas and activities to explore (in a way that doesn't overwhelm you with map icons). Sometimes it's just nice to take a ride on your horse through the beautiful countryside and soak it in --the wind in the trees, the wildlife, the shrines. Or maybe you'd like to wander through a town and listen to conversations, watch some interactions, and maybe do some trade. You can also decorate your home base with items you accumulate over time, read codex entries, test out different skills... Suffice to say, it's an enjoyable space to just be in, independently of game mechanics or storylines.

As for mechanics, Naoe is a spicy little murder kitten, with acrobatic stunt moves and deadly weapon skills packed into her small frame. I haven't even tried playing Yasuke yet (the black samurai who is an actual, genuine person from actual Japanese history, btw). I'm sure he's great. But I know that he's not stealth-oriented, and stealth assassination is my jam. I suppose he's there for the players who prefer a more combat-heavy playstyle.

Naoe isn't the fighter that Yasuke is, but she holds her own well enough when you time your dodges and parries and don't let yourself get surrounded. Each weapon type also has its own skill tree -- and skill points can be reset at any time, for free, which is a nice touch. I hate having to commit to point allocations without knowing if they are going to work for me later. And there's none of that bewildering skill tree layout that we saw in Valhalla. We're back to basics here.

Also, I definitely recommend playing with the Japanese voice acting from the very beginning. It's just way better.

It seems that a lot of people were prepared to hate on this game, but I think it's the best AC game that I've played in a long time. The landscape may not be as gorgeous as the Mediterranean.

190835234,english,"It’s disappointing to see how much hate Assassin’s Creed Shadows has received, especially when much of the criticism seems rooted in identity politics rather than the actual game. For the past year, I’ve watched streamers and internet commenters trash it...many of whom don’t seem to understand how games are made.

Going into Shadows, I kept an open mind. The last AC game I played was a bit of Odyssey, but before that, I was deeply into Assassin’s Creed 1-4 (Black Flag is my all time favorite). Right away, I was struck by how visually stunning the game is. While the mechanics aren’t as polished as Ghost of Tsushima, they’re still solid. The stealth combat is tense, strategic, and incredibly satisfying. Playing as the samurai was awesome, and the opening sequence was unforgettable. I even got to decapitate an enemy in a cinematic moment that set the tone perfectly.

Now, let’s address the elephant in the room: historical accuracy. Sure, people will argue about whether there were Black samurai or female shinobi, but at the end of the day, this is a video game (everyone take a deep breath). Suddenly, everyone becomes an expert in Japanese history when an AC game drops. If you can step back and appreciate Shadows for what it is—a stylish, action-packed experience with Kill Bill-style storytelling—you’ll have a great time.

I’ve also seen complaints about the property-building mechanics. Yes, you do have to build out your property, and yes, it’s fun. It adds depth to the game and rewards you with useful upgrades.

I’m about 3-4 hours in, and so far, I’m loving it. If you go in with an open mind and a willingness to enjoy the experience for what it is, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is absolutely worth playing. The developers clearly put a lot of effort into this game, and it shows. I highly recommend it!

190834548,english,"I didn't have high expectations for this game, given Ubisoft's recent releases, and I only bought it because I absolutely love Japan and its culture. I was drawn to the idea of playing an open-world stealth game set in this environment. First, let's talk about what I really like about this game. The visuals, art style, audio, and stealth mechanics are amazing. I'm really happy with the stealth aspect and wish they would focus more on it, but I understand they want to cater to everyone—at least it's not as disappointing as Valhalla. These elements truly feel like they belong in a next-generation game, and I'm pleased with what Ubisoft has accomplished.

However, the story, writing, some animations, and cutscenes are on the opposite end of the spectrum. I'm sorry, but a 5-year-old could have done better. It feels so unnatural, like you can tell what they were aiming for, but the execution is just incredibly poor. I have no sympathy or emotional connection to the characters because it constantly breaks the illusion.

As a person that has played every Assassins Creed game I like Shadows its different. The combat is simple and has stayed the same from most the other Assassins Creed games but I am OK with that. I enjoy the massive world and think its fun exploring the different areas with changing seasons. 
The implementation of two characters you can jump between is pretty cool especially being able to jump between the two whenever you want. Both have their own style for those that want to play the stealth of the Assassins can play Naoe and for those that want to just obliterate everything and everyone can play as Yasuke. Just a warning Yasuke can not really jump or parkour so you cant really use him to reach viewpoints.
There is some side objectives and side quest that require you to play has a certain character.
The parkour is different from the old games but I understand the Japanese design makes it hard to create the same parkour and think what they did was good. 
The voice acting is little off so I play with immersive mode so everyone speaks Japanese.

 I am over the cry babies saying they went away from what Assassins Creed was these same cry babies would be crying if they had kept doing the same old mechanics over and over.

Game-play wise it's a mixed bag - at least from my current progression. Combat does not have the same depth as ghost of tsushima, and enemies just have the same moves. Although, the stealth aspect is well done IMO. 

Story is decent so far. The first few hours have so many unnecessary and dragged-out cut scenes, almost as if this is Ubisoft preventing you from refunding the game within the first 2 hours. I'm also not a fan of the English voice acting, so I recommend using Japanese for full immersion.

I have played all of the main releases and some of the spin-offs.  I have not yet finished AC Shadows, but this is my opinion 16 hours in.  If something major changes, I will edit this review.

[b]TLDR:[/b]  This may be my favorite entry in the AC series.  I consider it to be the best of the recent RPG-style AC games, and it only competes with my fond childhood memories of ACII and Brotherhood.

[h2]Setting[/h2]
I was interested to see how Ubisoft would handle a historical game set in Japan.  Given the prominence of the ""ninja"" as an assassin archetype in media, an AC game set in feudal Japan always seemed like a logical extension.  If anything, I'm shocked that they kept their powder dry as long as they did.  I also came into the game somewhat cautious.  I used to live and work in Japan (you even get to visit my hometown in-game), and I speak Japanese.  I have developed - let's say - [i]strong[/i] opinions about the ways that Westerners interact with Japan, Japanese culture, Japanese history, and Japanese people.  Overall, I'm quite impressed.  Sure, the history is distorted a bit to better fit the narrative of the game, but it is done respectfully and is perfectly in line with similar decisions that the writing team has made for their other games.  Various aspects of the culture are incorporated in interesting ways that make the game world feel distinctly Japanese without crassly gamifying or exoticizing it.  I played the game in “immersion mode”, and the Japanese dialogue is great!  A lot of it is in a more modern dialect that doesn’t quite fit the 1500s, but I don’t care.  The localization is really good, too.  A couple of choices had me scratching my head, but quibbling over minor localization choices in a game with this much text and script is inevitable.  The VAs delivering the lines gave good performances.  I can remember an instance or two of lines that didn’t flow perfectly, but this is trivial.  The visual depiction of Japan is stunning and feels very authentic.  The scale is obviously compressed (as it is with almost all games), but the [i]feel[/i] is spot-on.  The landscape, architecture, and fashion look great.  Yes, the main character looks pretty flashy (sometimes jarringly so), but this is typical of AC games - you are a hero after all.  Personally, I used the built-in equipment transmog system to wear something more muted.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Most importantly, this game is FUN!  The AC staple of “climb to a high place to reveal the map” has been supplemented by a system of scouts that can provide more detailed information about an area and its features and objectives.  This feels more immersive while still making navigation easy.  The world itself is filled with things to do, but it has less of the bloat that has come to define Ubisoft games.  Base building is a blast with a bevy of options for both aesthetic and mechanical customization.  I consider this the best base building in AC so far - dethroning the ACII manor.  The combat is difficult but rewarding.  The parry and dodge windows are pretty narrow for a player of my skill, but hitting them properly is so satisfying.  The game eschews the dizzying array of weapon types from some of the recent entries in the series in favor of more depth in those that it keeps.  As someone who mostly found my preferred loadout and stuck with it in those other games, this is purely a plus for me.  Tools in AC games tend to be mostly useless with the occasional OP item.  In AC Shadows, they all feel like they have a purpose, though the smoke bombs skirt OP territory.  I love skill progression, and AC Shadows does not disappoint.  Though there are still some +X% to Y characteristic upgrades, most of the choices feel like they change gameplay in meaningful ways.  AC Syndicate’s Evie and Jacob Frye walked so that Naoe and Yasuke could run.  The dual protagonists are implemented incredibly well.  The two have significantly different skill sets leading to vastly different gameplay experiences when using each.  Their respective weaknesses also make the strengths of the other feel that much more pronounced.  The relative difficulty of stealth, combat, and mobility varies across the AC series as systems have been added, removed, or tweaked.  This makes comparing characters difficult across games.  For example, is Altair a wimp compared to Ezio, or are their apparent gaps due to changes in games’ systems?  Both Naoe and Yasuke are fun to play, but Naoe [i]feels[/i] much more like a sneaky, calculating assassin after you’ve played Yasuke, and Yasuke [i]feels[/i] much more like a human wrecking ball after you’ve played Naoe.  They each have compelling, independent stories that allow you to see different aspects of the world.  NPCs even react differently to the two characters, driving home the distinction.

[h2]BuT yAsUkE iS bLaCk[/h2]
I have made my reasons for liking this game clear by this point, and I am embarrassed to even comment on this.  Unfortunately, the backlash to this character is the elephant in the room, and I feel that I should address it.  The second of the game’s dual protagonists, Yasuke, is a black man.  He is loosely based on a black man who historically lived in Japan during this period but about whom relatively little is known.  AC does not purport to be purely historical (have we forgotten the literal aliens?), and most (if not all) of AC’s previous protagonists lack even the pretense of a connection to a historical person.  Even so, Yasuke’s presence has been derided as “ahistorical”.  The question isn’t whether or not AC Shadows represents an accurate depiction of the life of the historical man who inspired Yasuke (it doesn’t do this for [i]any[/i] character), rather it is whether the story of Yasuke in AC Shadows bears sufficient historical verisimilitude for the genre (it does).  The reason behind Diogo’s presence in Japan makes perfect sense.  The story deals considerably with the impact of the Portuguese presence, and the existence of a black slave among the Portuguese in the 1500s is pretty unremarkable.  A leader demanding the service of someone of another race as a court curiosity, symbol of influence, and soldier/bodyguard was very common during the feudal period.  European courts routinely displayed black men and “Turks” (they had a pretty broad definition of a Turk), the Byzantines had their Varangians, etc.  Cards on the table, I think that the criticisms of Yasuke are in bad faith and come from people who have become increasingly hostile to the depictions of non-white people, women, and LGBT people in games (particularly as protagonists).  They clearly do not hold the values implied by their ostensible criticisms as they fail to express them in any context that does not advance their preferred position in the culture war.  If ACIII: Liberation or Black Flag’s Freedom Cry DLC were released today, these people would be firebombing Ubisoft’s offices.  Bigotry is by far the most parsimonious explanation.

[h2]Summary[/h2]
I can’t end my review on that note!  All-in-all, AC Shadows is phenomenal and may be the highest point that the series has yet reached.  When playing as Naoe, the game succeeds where Mirage failed by delivering that classic AC feel with modern conveniences.  When playing as Yasuke, the game delivers a refined version of the heroic 3rd person action that the series has been leaning into since Origins.  If you can play only one AC game in 2025, make it AC Shadows.  I cannot recommend it enthusiastically enough.",True,0,1,1742588530,76561198021177345,5672

Now, I wish the game didn't have a freaking cash shop in the pause menu. It's a single player game with a cash shop, are you serious? It feels like the game is just a product being bastardized to generate as much revenue as possible. Incredibly insincere and in poor taste, most other AAA single player games don't have any kind of microtransactions in the game. (I.E. Baldurs Gate 3, Elden Ring, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, FF7 Rebirth, The Last of Us 2, etc). And those games are universally considered to be better purchases than this one.

Review
If any other company released this game it would be overwhelmingly positive, but because its Ubisoft, people will complain about things that are not worth complaining about.
Fps is great, well above 90. Graphics in ultra. No lag no stutter. The only one down side i have is 30 fps cut-scenes and they look like they have a bit of pull because of it.

You will do the same 5 things in every region over and over again. The two protag system is just annoying, they could just as well use only 1. It is annoying when you have to switch characters just to do a minigame or enter a cave.

First impressions:
A very, VERY promising start and a surprise hit for me this year. I really didn't expect this to be any good; I'm one of the ""old-school"" fans of the series who always preferred the Ezio style games over the RPG games. That being said, this game hooked me. From less bloat, to more bold decisions from Ubisoft, I cannot help but say that they did a pretty good job!

You now have to EXPLORE the world, with less moving from waypoint to waypoint. A lot of the bloat from the previous RPG games has been trimmed down, and everything feels more meaningful.

Stealth is genuinely the best it's ever been in the series.

Combat is nice, punchy and satisfying. It's also quite difficult, especially as Naoe who has limited health.

There's aspects that are amazing, like the visuals at times, the audio, when Naoes moves work and she doesn't get stuck on the wrong ledge like Altair and then there's the stuff that's been in all the AC games since, I don't know, forever.

This game features underbrush that is a pain to run through and way too many deer even for a period where roadkill wasn't a thing yet, no fish in the water though, except for a couple random manta rays off some cast, speak of overfishing, and on the second day of play on GFN it's plagued with bugs and janky mechanics, like many Ubisoft titles, DLSS frame generation isn't always available when the game launches and that means 50~ fps instead of 90. 
The first day the framerate limiter that's turned off took it way to literal and ran the game at 600ish fps at times causing very sped up moments, but Naoes move set felt smooth and it was good fun. Today is very much plagued by jank, currently in a boss battle that is clearly meant to be completed by Yasuke, but once you pick Naoe there's no switching back and instead of staying there and taking care of the adds like would make sense based on the cutscene seconds earlier, he just disappears, doesn't even use a smoke bomb, just teleports himself out and leaves you to clean up the mess.

Apart from the fact that I'm not really into cars and not into murdering sex workers to get your money back either, I have to say Rockstar releases one title every now and then and they polish that stuff.
Ubisoft did another kinda cool, with many old ideas, some new, forcibly introduced ones, many kinda functioning systems, a lot of superfluous bulk and jank. The jank is what gets me. 

Now, I know, I could just go into the gameplay settings and turn on the ""assassination guaranteed"" check box, which means you actually know the folks die from getting an 8 inch blade stabbed into their neck, like ""realism"", or whatever, but what's the point.

It's not bad nor is it (in the opening hours) amazing, it's just very generic. The first couple of hours are weirdly set out jumping from 6 months ago to now to a few hours ago to 2 years before. You play a prologue where you kill loads of people, learn how to do stuff and THEN you have a tutorial that teaches you the mechanics you have just spent an hour using. It's like you have a rush of combat high then have to put up with the monotony of ""do this 4 times, then do this 4 times then spa the walk with someone to do a chore"" its boring even for the short period of time it lasts.

The game throws all the normal tropes at you during the quite exhilarating opening and is fun to play, but the game is plagued by little bugs (such as DLSS vanishing or frame generation randomly turning off or even assassinations straight up not damaging npcs) that don't break the game but do take away from the experience. 

I'm trying to weigh up if this is worth £60 and I'm leaning towards no. I could honestly do with another hour to mae up my mind.

190824932,english,"Ubisoft has finally done it. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the Feudal Japan entry fans have been clamoring for since the series began over fifteen years ago—and it delivers in spades. This isn't just another open-world AC game with a fresh coat of cherry blossoms. It's a reimagining of the series’ identity, blending stealth, strategy, and cinematic storytelling in one of the most compelling settings the franchise has ever explored.

From the moment you step into the sandals of Naoe, a shinobi raised in the shadows, or Yasuke, the legendary African samurai, Shadows sets the tone for a dual-protagonist experience that actually works. Naoe brings back the series' classic stealth gameplay—rooftop traversal, silent assassinations, hidden blades and all—while Yasuke offers a more brutal, honorable path, wielding heavy weapons and commanding the battlefield with raw force. The dynamic between the two is more than a gimmick; it’s a meaningful evolution that keeps the gameplay fresh without feeling like you’re being yanked between genres.

Visually, the game is jaw-dropping. Feudal Japan is rendered in rich, painterly detail, from rain-soaked bamboo forests to snow-covered shrines perched on mountain cliffs. Lighting is especially noteworthy, with shadows (no pun intended) playing a major role in both gameplay and aesthetic. Enemy patrols are more responsive to environmental cues, and stealth mechanics finally feel like they’ve caught up to modern standards. Ubisoft’s Anvil engine is working overtime here, and it shows.

Combat is tight, weighty, and beautifully animated. The days of mashing buttons are over—Shadows rewards timing, precision, and adapting to your enemies' styles. Yasuke's samurai duels feel straight out of a Kurosawa film, while Naoe’s hit-and-fade tactics let you relive the fantasy of being a ghost in the dark.

The story is mature and well-paced, touching on themes of identity, loyalty, and the clash of tradition vs. change. It doesn’t shy away from the historical complexities of the Sengoku period, but it also knows how to tell a good tale. The side quests are robust and layered, often adding emotional or historical context that deepens your investment in the world.

Yes, it still has some of the standard Ubisoft open-world DNA—climbing towers (or pagodas), looting camps, and syncing viewpoints—but these activities are better integrated and feel less like checklists than in previous entries.

Final Verdict:
Assassin’s Creed Shadows isn’t just a great Assassin’s Creed game—it’s one of the best in the series’ long history. It’s the culmination of years of experimentation and iteration, now sharpened to a katana’s edge. Whether you’ve been waiting for a return to stealth or just wanted to don a straw hat and prowl the rooftops of Kyoto, this is the leap of faith you’ve been waiting for.

Score: 9.5/10

Animations - Are really cool.....the first ten times. I have done the jump behind throat cut animation with Naoe, not exaggerating 50 times in the 7 hours I've played. There's no variety.

Stealth - Same as any Assassin's Creed. Nothing has really changed or improved. 

Camera - Absolute dogshit. Half the time I can't even see the prompts of whether to parry or dodge because the camera is in a wall. 

Parkour System - It seems like it gets worse in every game. I don't understand how it is this bad. I'll be climbing up a wall and they just randomly stop for no reason. Or I'll be going straight up and they'll go left or right and get stuck on a ledge. 

The world is beautiful and the story has kept me wanting to play more to experience it. 

Maybe it's because I just came from KCD 2 and that is such an amazing game, but this is just another Ubisoft bloatware piece of shit.

The horse is garbage, Better off going everywhere on foot. But they don't really want you to do that and that's why they introduced the pathfinding system.

I gave it a good review at first but now that I'm many hours in, it's the same slop from the previous new games.  Massive world, everything is copy and paste, next to none interesting attacks on missions.  The chick does feel like an assassin from the old games but the mmo combat style ruins this game still.  It doesn't have the finesse of the old games.  The guy, useless, absolutely terrible writing, mechanics and combat style.  He's just a brute guy with a weapon, nothing more nothing less, hes nearly useless especially since they changed to mmo combat. At least with the old games you could use the heavy weapons too but they smacked people but you were slow and certain ai could wreck your day back then.  Now it's all hack and slash.  I've done the same 3 activities throughout the whole game and that's all there is.  The assassinations  feel pointless, most of the time it's just some guy with a few guards in an open world for you to explore and plot your attack, I'm being fallacious. There's nothing interesting to plan, it's kill the guards hopefully able to kill one shot assassinate, or you are now forced into a big fight unless you turn on instant assassinations. The world being so large with so little to do that actually interests you I'm now skipping through all the dialog to just finish this game I feel I now wasted my money on so it's not a total waste.  I was into the story but now this guy just shows up when I'm talking as the girl and I'm like you have not been present for the last 2 hours, why are you here all of the sudden and why is the game making me choose finishing a section with you present.  The game also forces you to play as the non assassin guy for big sections of the game that forces you into this god awful combat system of hack and slash parry and doge where it's literally just hack and slash and use god like abilities, yes because he's like 6ft 250 he can sprint through doors and walls no problem, give me a break.  This is the last Ubisoft game I'll ever play.  I'm genuinely threw with it.  I didn't get the last two and had some hope for this one but I'll never buy another game from this company.  They've ruined every series I've loved with just copy and paste so they can turn over a quick buck. The story in all their games are awful now, the game play awful, things to do nothing.  If they're going to make a map that takes 20-30 hrs to fully explore, they have to add more things than just 3 types of actives that are the exact same garbage over, and over and over again.  And you really have to do them to get xp and skill points whatever they call it.  I'm so fed up with this company and the garbage they put out. Also why can't the assassin use a bow, like really.  I'm just venting at this point.  Don't get this game, they ruined AC, it sucks now, they ruined far cry, ruined R6 Siege, and guess what, micro transactions galore, and many are pay to win already.

When I went head-to-head with an enemy, the flow and thrill of the fight worked well, and switching between assassin and warrior gave me a great deal of satisfaction in all areas.

The sound effects and music in the game are excellent, and I love the mix of modern and classical presentations.
NAOE is a very pretty and lovely girl, the various portrayals of her are very good, I think I'm in love with her already <3

190817438,english,"Might change this review later on, but for now:

[h1]The Good:[/h1]

• Graphics are nice.

• Landscapes are A LOT better than the old trilogy. Every step and angle looks like a photography. It's no longer a grass plain with a few rocks and trees, they are all interesting to explore and appreciate.

• The new cutscenes are great.

• I like how the protagonists participate in social events, parties and meetings from Feudal Japan. It makes these stories and characters more believables. Very immersive.

• Touching story with interesting character development. So far the best story I've seen in an AC game in a long time.

• Less Ubisoft-like icons. A way more natural and dynamic approach to exploration.

• Loot is less important, so leaving chests behind on outspots is not as punished as in the old trilogy. Finding chests now feels interesting, not a chore, which is nice.

• More varied gameplay loop: no longer based merely on visiting outposts - killing everyone - looting everything - finding next outpost. We now have housing, dynamic events, interesting side activities... More variation.

• Optimization is great. This game is running the same tech as Monster Hunter Wilds, which shortens development times at the cost of performance. However, AC Shadows runs pretty much ""as good as it can"" with the tech it's using.


[h1]The Bad:[/h1]

• The combat style has received some tweaks, but I still don't think a souls-like combat gameplay fits Assassin's Creed. This game is supposed to be immersive, cool and badass. It should focus on looking realistic, cool and badass, not o focusing the enemy and rotate around him waiting for a parry like this is Dark Souls. Stabbing an enemy 67 times in a realistic immersive game like Assassin's Creed feels off and these janky goofy ass souls-like combat animations are absolutely immersion breaking. 

• Naoe is the true protagonist. Not because Yasuke isn't cool or anything, but because he is so heavily nerfed in core mechanics he can't even reach some of the collectables: Yasuke can't climb and he is almost useless in stealth, while Naoe can do everything and she is simply a little bit less effective in combat (but she can still parry, block and deal damage). I like Yasuke as a character, but I'm having such a difficult time playing as him... Not being able to parkour nor do some basic stealth on an Assassin's Creed game is horrendous and such a huge nerf compared to what Naoe gets, which is simply a small combat damage reduction. There are not a lot of reasons to play as Yasuke and I think most people will simply stick to using Naoe, I think this has not been properly balanced nor considered and it kind of destroys the whole point of having two protagonists.


[h1]The Uggly:[/h1]

• The game has a pretty weird personality I don't fully enjoy. It tries to incorporate japanese action and scenery elements typical from mangas or japanese cinematography, mixed with an intention of feeling youthful and modern... The mixure is weird and I don't know how to feel about it. I think it would have been preferable sticking to an OG PS3-era Assassin's Creed style, or a full classical japanese personality in the style of Ghost of Tsushima. This weird modern middle point is a little bit awkward sometimes.

• The game has some minor but frustrating bugs. Sometimes the music stops working and you have to quit and re-enter the game to get it back working. I've also encountered some instances where I assessinate enemies but they get up again with full health, putting an end to my stealth run. Pretty sure they'll get these fixed soon though, it's still a very polished game and I've not encountered any more major issues.

• While the new dialogue cameras are great, they still need to work on expressions. They still feel a little soul-less and robotic.


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

Pretty good Assassin's Creed game so far. Enjoying it a lot. Fixes a lot of issues from previous AC RPG games such as those uninteresting landscapes (which now look amazing in Shadows), but also carries some of the issues from those ones such as the absolutely horrendous combat system.

It has some rough edges, but it's a pretty good Assassin's Creed game and, in my opinion, the best RPG-style game they have released so far.

Absolutely recommended.


[h1]Edit: 50 Hours-in Review[/h1]

I maintain almost all I said on this review. Worth mentioning:

• Yasuke gets a bow, which highly improves his stealth. He is still way more nerfed overall than Naoe though.

• Most of the collectables on the first half of the game are intended for Naoe, which makes sense, as you actually unlock Yasuke after completing that region. There are also a lot of collectables on later regions which are only reachable for Yasuke, so both characters have exclussive activities only they can complete during world-exploration. Which makes sense, but...

• Character swapping feels slow, tedious and abrupt due to the loading screens. In my opinion, it kind of breaks the gameplay rhythm and I'd have prefered being able to complete all world-exploration side objectives with one character of my choice, swapping them whenever I want to, and not when I feel abruptly forced to when casually discovering new locations during exploration.

• I've found out you can lower the combat difficulty without lowering the stealth difficulty on in-game sttings. This lowers enemy health, which obviously makes the combat extremely easy, but also more similar to how it was on the original Assassin's Creed games, where you could finish an enemy with a simple counter-attack and get a flashy animation. I don't look for a challenge in an Assassin's Creed game, I look fo immersion, and killing enemies with 1~3 cuts feels a lot more immersive than stabbing them a thousand times. It's worth mentioning the game's combat is highly customizable so you can tweak it to better suit your needs and playstyle. Not an ideal solution, would have prefered short and thrilling encounters based on reflects where you slay the enemy easily but also die easily. But it is what it is.

• The game is filled with small, immersive little details. Here are some of them:
- You can see wild life's breath mist on cold weather (of course, human NPC & PC too).
- Guards get sleepy on summer due to the high temperatures.
- Guards tend to meet around fires and they stay together in groups to keep warm on winter.
- Naoe and Yasuke get dirty when crawling or dodging on soil.
- The landscape and towns dynamically get snowy during blizzards.
- The landscape's snow dynamically melts when the temperature gets higher again.
- Atmospheric sound design changes every weather. From wind, to rivers.
- More cool stuff(tm) I don't want to write. Play it for yourself and find out.


[h1]2nd Conclusion.[/h1]
I still recommend the game. Do keep in mind I've dedicated more lines on this analysis to the small little things I think they didn't really nailed, and some of the features that bug me on a final product that, as a whole, I think is still very enjoyable. I have simply focused more on the features I didn't like. You'll surely find other reviews out there highlighting more of what the game does right.

Do keep in mind that I am still recommending the game, even though all the negative points I have listed. That's because I feel the game hits more nails than the ones it misses, and it's an overall very enjoyable experience (for me) even though it has some flaws (in my opinion).

That said, I've listed all the negative aspects I didn't enjoy, so you can make your own decission on how important those flaws are to you. This review is long. Do not limit yourself to the ""aproved / failed"" conclussion. Read it. Make your own conclusions. Decide for yourself.

190816497,english,"The Assassin’s Creed series has always been known for presenting historical events through the eyes of a fictional character, never using real historical figures as actual protagonists—especially not controversial ones. For example, in AC II, Nicolaus Copernicus appeared (mistakenly referred to as Prussian, even though he was from Poland), but he wasn’t randomly turned into an Assassin. The Assassin’s motto has always been:

""We work in the dark to serve the light. We are Assassins.""

Characters who took part in historical events often appeared like shadows in history, silently observing key moments that shaped both nations and the world, such as the Pazzi Conspiracy against the Medici, the French Revolution, the Boston Tea Party, Marx deceiving the poor, and the British reclaiming Nassau from pirates.

Even though the developers meant well, they completely messed it up. They bet on the wrong horse—Yasuke was not a samurai, yet he is constantly called one. If he truly were a samurai, he would have committed seppuku after Oda Nobunaga’s death instead of being sent away from Japan. The first non-Japanese samurai was William Adams, who arrived in Japan in 1600—not some clueless villager who didn’t even speak the language. (Japanese history clearly states that Yasuke was more like an animal—he only understood basic commands like ""eat,"" ""stay,"" and ""fight."")

If you wanted to create a real Samurai-Ninja who actually existed, I’ll tell you—there was one: Hattori Hanzō, who was both a samurai and a ninja. Or you could have used the legendary Sarutobi Sasuke, a shadowy figure that Naruto fans would have loved. But no—Woke culture took over...

I wanted to give this game a chance, and I have to say—I’m disappointed.

Flaws
Historical setting—ruined. They bragged so much about this game being historically accurate, even hiring a so-called ""expert"" (who conveniently disappeared from the internet once people read his nonsense). Instead of a fantasy-fiction Brit who wrote a book with no evidence, they should have consulted a real Japanese historian specializing in the Sengoku period.

Gameplay—A step backward. Compared to Mirage, this is a regression. Sure, there are a few good additions, like crawling, but overall, the character feels like paper. AC Odyssey felt much better in terms of mechanics. Despite a few interesting features, the gameplay is a downgrade.

Graphics—A joke. We waited so long, and yet even distant objects don’t render properly. Black Flag—a much older game—handled this better. Clearly, optimization is not something Ubisoft is familiar with.

Other Issues
The parkour system is laughable. Naoe does so many unnecessary flips it’s ridiculous. Compared to Arno, it’s like a circus acrobat vs. an actual parkour athlete—completely unnatural. (AC Unity and Syndicate had the best parkour—so why didn’t Ubisoft learn from them? Did they lose the devs who worked on those games?)

Visuals are underwhelming. Despite four delays, the game still looks worse than AC Odyssey, which is unacceptable.

First off, I'm sorry to any of y'all that are having difficulties with Ubi Connect, 
I have nothing to add with Ubisoft Connect and performance issues.
I haven't had any issues with Ubisoft connect (except for one brief moment it said I couldn't log in, but I just tried again and it worked). I also haven't had any performance issues at all. The game doesn't look the best for me but that's because I'm on a rig with components at least 6-8 years old but it's running fine, just make sure it's on your main SSD. It gives you a very heavy-handed suggestion to install the game on an SSD but that should really be a requirement unless you want to basically turn off cutscenes (Also it should be installed on your main SSD, sometimes Windows identifies secondary SSD's as HDD's, that's not Ubi's problem)
Onto the ACTUAL game, it's gorgeous, it's smooth, it feels real, it's incredibly immersive, we don't have puppets on strings like we did with AC Odyssey or shallow go-nowhere dialogue like in Origins. Shadow has depth and care at every corner of it's production and is just FUN. It's JUST FUN to be a shinobi assassin crawling through the grass of a lantern lit castle garden. The entire game just screams the Hokkaido mission from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory which I think we can all safely agree is the best Splinter Cell mission ever.
Typical ubi bugs are still around, but nothing has been game-breaking or anywise more immersion breaking than any other game nowadays so any of that criticism is wanton in my opinion, as if the value of the entire game hinges on a failed animation or the ability of my character's cloak to flutter properly in the wind.",True,0,1,1742576404,76561198036183849,1980

Parkour, as it has been for the last decade, is still dumbed down. Side eject is once again dead, even though it was frankenstein'd back to life in Mirage. Please bring my son home.

Kicking people as Yasuke is funny every time, good ragdolls, good distance.

The castles and fortresses, being scaled closely to real life size, make for large and interesting outposts to clear.

I was surprised by just how different Yasuke and Naoe play, it legitimately feels like playing two different games. I appreciate Ubi taking the criticism of Eivor to heart of ""how could a random viking know how to climb any building?"" by just not letting Yasuke climb anything that doesn't have large handholds or is within his jump height like fences.

I've seen people complain about Naoe's English performance, honestly I think the stunted delivery fits her, she's not charismatic and she seems to actually, genuinely revel in the suffering of the people she kills. I mean she gut stabs most guards and you're free to execute harmless servants for +5 xp. She is not mentally stable.

I'm also glad Ubi isnt doing what they did with Unity anymore where they changed the accents of the region to something else, like how they made all the French speak with British accents. Japanese accents, very nice.

The use of J-Rock at points can seem a little at odds with whatever's happening on screen, the best fit so far was it being used during a boss fight in a burning  building, the worst example being part of a murder montage when not even a minute before Naoe was distressed at killing one man.

I like that quest items and targets are always in the world, I've killed most of an organization and I still don't know who they are, very cool.

This is probably the most graphically beautiful game on the market now, and with the weather and seasons, its a full package for anyone who enjoys a nice landscape. Of course that comes with the caveat that if its not on an SSD and you don't have good specs that you won't get to play it.

The return of the cultural discovery codex from Mirage is wonderful, as someone who majorly plays these games for the incredibly detailed recreations of historical locations, the extra info with sources given is a nice touch and a good evolution from the old school info codex.

[b] The childish, ignorant discourse around Yasuke's inclusion is sad. History is full of characters like Yasuke; Joan of Arc, Hatshepsut, Joseph Brant, Zheng Yi Sao, Alan Turing, and on and on and on.

Good;

1. Combat is fluid
2. Environment is detailed - looks good
3. Stable launch - and should get much better after updates
4. Good enough A.I. for stealth combat
5. Story and Voice acting in Japanese is well done
5. Side content 

The not so good;

1. They lied. You can not switch characters any time you want. You are forced to play the female protagonist for the first act, which will take many hours before you unlock Yasuke.

2. Exploration mode that is recommended by content creators for the achievement is not worth it. It basically hides your next objectives, and even if you run around with your detect ability you wont necessarily run into the person you want to find. So I do not recommend the exploration feature since its tweaked to be annoying when they should fine tune it to be a bit more use friendly.

Still too early into the game, but just based on this, I know this is a good game but it has its faults. I thought I should at least mention those faults that others are not mentioning.

Other mention should be for what ever reason the settings seems random. DLSS will appear then not appear. So while I can recommend this game, its better to wait it out to get a more up to date game at least for PC. 

Even on steam you need to disable certain control settings to be able to use a PS5 controller, which I think is also something of a must with these kind of games.

I spent two hours trying to find an NPC to progress through a quest, gave up, and started running in random directions and clearing enemy outposts and castles.  I did eventually come back to finish the quest after having looked up the location of the NPC on Gamefaqs, which one should never have to do.  Overall, the game's story is told in a painfully slow and uninteresting way, which makes me actively not want to interact with it, but instead waddle away and mindlessly stealth kill (with guaranteed assassination turned on) more Japanese dudes.  It's a game for people who want to zone out and do a whole lot of nothing for a few hours.  It's ninja Skyrim.

The ray traced lighting and global illumination in this game is genuinely impressive and extremely transformative in a way that I hope becomes more accessible to a wider audience.  I understand that ray tracing is expensive and not everyone can experience it comfortably yet, but it is 100% the way to go, it's absolutely gorgeous.

I actively avoid playing as the 900lb brick that's in the game for some reason, not sure why they put that there.  It doesn't feel or look right, and I don't like it.

Go to the point, collect stuff along the way, raid a castle to get some gear, talk to the person, follow him around, talk again, maybe fight - repeat 3-4 times and fight another main guy from the circle.

Task loop is the same, over and over again. Random fights with elite ronins were fun, but it was a bit small circle to complete. You level up, but it doesn't mean anything since enemies level up instantly. Knowledge points are a real drag. Mastery points are alright.

And later in the game after you unlock Yasuke all the talking and dialogues become dumb. Like AI dumb. I can't imagine doing same stuff any longer.

- actuall gear drops instead of boring upgrade mats like vallhalla
- two characters that actually ARE different and not just male and female option.
- faster parkour
- better stealth(being in the complete dark stalking at the enemy right infront of me not seeing me is the closest feeling you will get to a splinter cell game)
- better story than oddysey but on par with origins.

i would basicly call shadows the unity of the rpg ac series (without the bugs) this is the most amount of change they tried to do compared to the previous rpg ac games and i can see them build on that in future ac games.

as for open world it's as big as origins but a bit smaller, there aren't many pointless collectables and hardly any boring sidequests to pick up. which for me is a good thing, and keeps the game from overstaying it's welcome that vallhalla did.

for combat, it's certainly different to origins, oddysey and vallhalla, it will be hard to get used to but once you level up a few times and get some skills you will see a drastic difference in combat. in the previews i was worried the enemies would just stand there, but i was glad to be proven wrong they are VERY agressive and if you do not play as yasuke you will have a hard time killing groups of 3 armoured enemies.

While no Ghost of Tsushima, as someone that has studied Japanese history, language and culture for over 20 years, this game is legit and Ubisoft did their homework. Highly recommend the immersion mode even if not familiar with the language. Love the dual protagonists that play very differently. The gfx detail, if your rig can handle it, in this game is astounding; from the weather particle effects, the little bubbles you see swimming underwater, to the wet hair effects and how long you stay soggy after getting wet. 
Story isn't bad so far, nothing groundbreaking. 

Yasuke (who has appeared in countless native Japanese games from the spin-off fuedal Japan Ryu Ga Gotoku/Yakuza games to all 4 Way of the Samurai games) is a beast.

(20 hours)-After about 18 hours in and completing Act 1 of the story, I can say this game will already be better than most assassins creed games in the last decade. Compared to the other 3 rpg games and even mirage, the combat is far better. Less hack and slash and having to use actual thinking skills, at least with naoe, while yasuke seems to be more for the rpg fans where he can just cut through everything but still requires some thought, though i havent had much time with him yet. The stealth is also the best in the series in my opinion, being able to crouch and prone on command and use the everything as cover and hiding spots dynamicly is so much more fun than premade haystacks and set spots, as well as using light sources to your advantage as well. Being able to be in the open as long as you stick to the shadows at night is the most stealth you can get. The quests are also far better than prevoius games, having to actual investigate an area and not have it marked for you directly is so much more fun and interactive, and you can narrow it down using scouts if you wish to get a smaller area, but scouts can be used for other things as well so use them wisely.

- The Basebuilding stuff is very cool
- Barely had any bugs so far (Only one is once an arrow hit me and i went flying thousands of feet in the sky lol)
- They nailed the setting and game world
- The variety you have with the 2 characters is great. The female is very good at stealth, while the guy is better at combat.

Negatives: 
- The game starts off VERY slow the first 2 hours, but gets a lot better later
- The overall story is not very good so far
- Running back and fort between quest givers can be a tad annoying.

190809464,english,"After investing hours into Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I can confidently say that Valhalla was a much more engaging and immersive experience. Shadows feels hollow in comparison—boring, empty, and lacking the soul that made previous entries great.

Combat is underwhelming and uninspired. Where Valhalla delivered weighty, brutal action with satisfying progression, Shadows feels like it’s holding back. The stealth is fine, but overall gameplay feels repetitive and lacks depth.

Base building, which was one of Valhalla’s most rewarding systems, is reduced to a forgettable mechanic in Shadows. There’s no real sense of growth, personalization, or ownership. It’s just there.

The world itself lacks immersion. The environments are beautiful, but they feel static. There’s little to pull you in or make you care about what’s happening. Even the story feels like it’s on rails—especially in Canon Mode—removing player agency and decision-making, including the ability to explore romance or affect key outcomes.

There’s also a heavy-handed woke influence that feels forced rather than natural, interfering with the tone and pacing. Instead of focusing on historical storytelling and rich world-building, it often feels like the game is trying too hard to check boxes.

Ubisoft had something powerful with Valhalla—a world you could shape, characters you could connect with, and systems that rewarded your choices. Shadows strips much of that away, leaving behind a pretty but shallow shell.

I think he's more for the new gamers who don't know how to play stealth games yet but still want to play this game and have fun. Naoe feels very much weak and it's challenging to play as her if I am not strategic. 
I don't think this game disrespects Japan or Japanese people except that one 'thing' that was patched on day one of release. Yasuke feels very humble and righteous character. I don't think his race matters all that much and I am Asian who love Japan.

Negative publicity actually led me to buy this game out of curiousity and I love Japan-based games. I own all the other games that have Japan settings. And this game does not disappoint if you love Japan like I do. I think people should give this game a try. I like how this game plays. I must say I prefer this game over other AC games.

For voice acting and character animation, I was expecting horrible job because of other reviews, but it was actually quite okay. Naoe and other characters show variety of emotions and their voice acting is alright. 
I am hoping to explore Japan in this game. The world is quite beautiful and frame rates are great.

It’s the first time in a while that I actually felt like an assassin while playing Assassin’s Creed. The stealth gameplay is very satisfying, and while the combat is just okay, it gets the job done. Naoe feels fast and moves smoothly, though sadly her parkour isn’t on par with the older AC games—but with this kind of open-world design, that’s probably not realistic anyway. The skill tree feels meaningful, and I’m always looking forward to leveling up. The shinobi/assassin fantasy is really well executed and genuinely fulfilling, in my opinion.

190807379,english,"A large amount of negative reviews show people that have only spent around 0.5-2 hours in the game. It is simply impossible to write a well meaning review with that much playtime simply because the prologue of the game is about that long. Unless they just skipped through all the cutscenes and in that case - idk how you could even take them seriously.

This game is great, it's not the most mindblowing game ever made from a gameplay perspective. It is fun though, it's what you'd expect from AC gameplay with some improvements here and there. The world and environments are incredible though, this is one of, if not, the most beautiful open world games I have ever played. Seriously, I can't overstate this enough, every inch of this map I've traveled through so far is breathtaking.

If you like AC games, you WILL like this game no question about that. They also give some extra difficulty options to make stealth more difficult and they even give an option for instant assassinations if you don't like the new AC method of some enemies not dying instantly.

My critiques - 
Parkour: I wish it was better, all the flips and stuff are cool but I really want to see the return of a dedicated jump control by tapping the parkour up button. You've got a dedicated dive roll for sprinting and tapping parkour down, so why not do the same for parkour up to jump? It's just odd... Just overall too, climbing stuff can feel really finicky and lacks fluidity and dynamics from earlier titles still like no diagonal climbing.

Combat: I really wanted to see more variety in animations but unfortunately, you get the same finisher animations so many times and it starts getting old pretty quick.

Stealth kills: Another thing I wanted to see have more animations... I was really disappointed to see that ubisoft kept in the ugly slice with the hidden blade when a NPC is sitting or in a position that doesn't allow for a normal assassination kill. 

Protagonist: Now I know some people might scream ""you're a racist!"" for this opinion but I really wish they went with a protag other than Yasuke. It's not as big of a deal to me as it is for other people and to me it has absolutely nothing to do with his skin color, I just feel like it was forced. No AC game in the past made you play as a real figure in history and I don't know why we needed to delve from that path in this game. I like the idea of being a ""hidden"" person in history that provokes historical changes in the shadows. It would've been cool to be just a random samurai that saw the injustices in what was happening and became a Ronin then meets with Naoe in a random encounter and realize they're fighting for the same cause.

-Ghost of Tsushima - Very similar to Assassin's Creed formula and much more respectful to the culture.

-Nioh 1 and 2 - Souls-like games with heavy historical inspiration and Japanese legends.

Is it the same formula as, say, Valhalla? Yes. 

But the game play, while simple, feels good. Stealth as Naoe feels good and rewarding and combat as Yasuke feels brutal and heavy. When it comes to the story of both of these characters, admittedly I am biased. 

I have always been the ""Reaper"" kind of stealth when it came to Assassins Creed titles, I enjoyed going in and fighting my way through, so Naoe is not my play style, but Yasuke is and therefore I cared more for his story. I also just love the setting, with Oda Nobunaga being one of my favorite historical figures of all time. 

And boy, the story? its a ride. In a good way! 

As I did more of his story more and more things clicked and questions were answered, even the question of ""Why is Yasukes armor more luxurious then Nobunagas?"" Is answered, at least from my understanding through assumption. 

A lot of the hate this game gets, I think, is unreasonable. IF you love the setting of Feudal Japan I think you will find some enjoyment in this game. 

If you enjoyed the combat of Valhalla and exploration of Odyssey then I think you will enjoy this game. 

The story is simple, but still leaves you wanting to know more. 

I am with some people, though. If you are kinda iffy on the open world side of the recent games, wait for a sale. Because this game leans pretty heavy on exploration of POIs <points and people> and sometimes the reward is not worth it.

So far I had not gone into any of the story or anything yet just stopped after unlocking hideout. 

The one thing I had been doing these whole time is just admiring the freaking view of the whole place going around with every UI hidden and totally immersing in the view of the environment. I actually set everything to maxxxed out at 1440p with  14900k and 3090. Averaging around 45-60 fps since I am not doing any fighting or anything I do not care about the combat atm. I will tweak them down when I actually decided to play the game. I am literally taken away by the environment tbh and just going around on my mount enjoying the view. 2 hours of my playtime actually wasted on hideout building lol. I hate myself to admit the fact that despite not agreeing with the whole agenda this game stand for. I do have to honestly and truthfully say that The graphics are superb not gonna lie. I just enjoy and admiring how beautiful japan countryside is to the point of just wandering around finding some torii with sakura in background and just literally standing afk watching that view and recording that scence to make my wallpaper. Thats how good the graphics are for me....

The rest of the game I am not even sure I am gonna play the game or not. I already hate the fact how they portray nobunaga in the beginning scence. Its just totally inaccurate at all. As far as I know nobunaga didn't talk with diogo when they first met each other at all. It took 6-7 months for diogo to learn the language. So starting from there I hate it. Diogo first battle which might also be his last is 2-3 years after they first met. So nope making diogo partook in that iga clan battle itself is not totally true in nature as far as I know. I might be wrong but truth to be told. Yasuke was never a commander nor captain at all. Making him one itself pissed me off already and I am not even japanese. I just love japanese sengoku period history and saga and stuff just like I like mythology and stuff of egypt and greek and norse. I grew up with watching those mythology movies.  Yasuke did not get regarded as true samurai ok up to his death but he is widely regarded full fledged warrior only. 

Would I recommend the game?!!  Here are the fact Graphics is totally inspiring and performance is smooth although I hate to admit it. I did not know anything  abt english dialogue at all. I listen in japanese voice and portugese voiceover option with subtitle. English voiceover always suck tbh when trying to partain asian based voice and seriousness of the topic.  
I know a bit of both portugese and japanese so I tried to  make sense of it that way and it is more immersive that way. 
Combat wise I do not know never go into battle yet except some battle in prologue and some. 

The historical value of this game is just does not exist which is one of the biggest factor I play AC franchise for. 
So its up to you guys whether you play this game or not. I am just gonna hop in here and there just to go around the whole land just to sightsee and go from there first. I am not hype to play the story at all nor want to play at all. But I do enjoy the building base section and the environment. Thats it for me.

190804580,english,"Man, how anticlimactic... all the build up and drama, Youtubers milking ""Ubisoft is so COOKED!"" content and at the end of it all, AC Shadows is just another same old Ubi game. Nothing great, nothing terribly offensive (gameplay-wise that is, Ubi has been plenty offensive to Japanese people lately...)

6 hours in, and Yasuke was playable for maybe 5 minutes? We all already knew his inclusion was just SSS tier virtue signaling, but so far it feels like he was tacked on way later in development because they got hoodwinked by that Lockley guy and his fanfiction. 

Naoe plays alright, though, and the different gear sets she gets look really cool. The biggest shock of all is how she actually looks feminine. I guess that's how desperate Ubisoft is that they're willing to go back to non-manjaw feminine designs for their female characters.

Anyway, I selected would not recommend based on full price. If you've played an AC game since Origins, there's nothing new here for you other than the ability to go prone and also a grappling hook. Which by the way, I don't like because now you cant just climb everything... they want you to use their silly grappling hook.

Origins was a fun reinvention of the franchise, and Odyssey was the apex of the AC RPG games. Everything just fell off a cliff after that one. Valhalla and even Shadows are still enjoyable enough if you like the formula, but maybe it's time for another reinvention. But if you're still interested in Shadows, wait like a week or two when they're selling it for $30.

I'm updating my review to say that you shouldn't even bother with this game at any price. I've really been trying with this game, but it's not good at all. Loot is pointless tiny little skill increments, the story isn't compelling at all, and this is some of the worst combat in an AC game.

The filler content is beyond Ubi insanity, if you clear one castle, that's it. They all play the exact same way, and they all look the same too. And like I mentioned, the loot for completing them isn't even worth it. If you do play this, I guess push through until you unlock Mr. Forced Diversity as fully playable.

It is so dull, like picture that one annoying coworker that wants to talk to you and instead of leaving details they explain it with no emotion, in the most broad way possible. In other words, they are absolutely boring and the biggest crime with this writing is the emotional scenes are so overly exaggerated that they feel fake and forced. The tone of this game is stale bread serious. 

I get why they made it so generalized. They have to account for the fact you are playing two characters but this is the same studio that made Odyssey which was a gem of good writing. I would give it a neutral rating but in my opinion the writing holds the game back with its plethora of three-four minute cut scenes.

When Assassin's Creed Shadows was announced, I was beyond excited. Despite the controversies surrounding it, I still pre-ordered the game on Steam, believing in the series as I always have.

On launch day, my friends and I gathered to experience this new chapter together — but I couldn’t even get past the startup. The game crashes immediately on launch. My PC, which runs other high-end games flawlessly, couldn’t handle this one. I tried everything: adjusting settings, verifying files, reinstalling the game four times… nothing worked. 
As of now, I’ve accumulated 119 minutes of ""gameplay,"" solely from trying to launch it.

I know the devs are working hard to fix things, but for a $100+ game, this is beyond frustrating. The hype and excitement for this release were completely ruined by technical issues.

PC players urgently need better support and, honestly, some form of compensation would be fair for those of us who paid full price and couldn’t even play on day one.

190801000,english,"Kinda decided to buy it in the end seeing all the positive reviews.
And well initially I wanted to wait for some sale, but so far being few hours in, I have to say I love it while playing as Naoe.
That is exactly what I wanted from AC game, the assassin route.
And even on normal difficulty it is actually challenging and fun where you have to plan it a little.
In comparison the only minus for me personally is Yasuke being forced in as 2nd MC and you being forced to play as him where his samurai combat style is just powering thing in without any kind of strategy so far and it will work.
I'm rather surprised Ubisoft didn't just go with what they did in Oddyssey or Valhalla and let player choose what MC they want to play for whole gameplay, seems they really wanted to force Yasuke in for some unknown reason, he could be just NPC who helps Naoe as her mentor friend, but no. It would be more fun to let player choose if they want to play as male or female Naoe, and then let player choose during the game when you level if you wanna become a shinobi or a samurai by your own point allocation route. Such approach would work better in my personal opinion.
And no, anyone saying that female samurai didn't exist, well female demigod warrior in Greece or female viking killing machine didn't either in their periods. But maybe it has something to do with initial censorship that you can't have female samurai in Japan as taboo or a woman warrior in Middle East set of games for that reason.
But as I read I can play almost whole game as Naoe if wanted so I'm aboard the AC train here.
No bugs so far, the visuals are stunning even on few years old PC with GeForce 3060ti there's no stutter, no frame drops when set at 60fps limit in fullHD and a mix of very high to ultra setting in detail.
I have to say I'm happily surprised remembering hell with initial Valhalla release.

190800539,english,"The stealth takes lights and shadows into account. You can extinguish or destroy light sources. You can also go prone on the ground to maximize stealth to get up to your query quietly. The animation for assassinating a person while prone on the ground is a slice to the ankle to get them to the ground and then the killing blow. In the buildings there are places to latch onto the ceiling to hide and assassinate from above. It's very satisfying.

I really like the use of the grappling hook. Not only will it quickly get you up and out of sight but you can use it to swing out to further places.

The sword play is good. As you are fighting you can see the enemies loose things like their hats in the fight. The enemy will block but you can counter it. You can also block, parry and counter the enemies attacks.

The graphics at max detail are also really amazing. It runs at 100+ FPS at 1440P native FSR AA and if frame gen is enabled it gets into the 125+ FPS range with a 9800X3D and a 7900XTX. A 5800X3D and 7900 XTX is only about 5 FPS slower. I haven't tried the game with my RTX 4070 yet but my expectation is it would do fine because the max settings I have used indicate that the vram is only at slightly over 8GB.

Story wise the samurai story reminds me a little of the movie the Last Samurai because the character of the movie and this game are considered outsiders but for whatever reason are accepted. I'll give it a shot and see what the narrative has to say. The assassins arc is tragic from what I have seen and I really enjoy the game play with her.

Most of the time you would be surprised how good it looks, but there gonna be a shit asset here and there, or the textures that could've been better, but overall the vibe is that it's a good looking game. I personally spend a lot of time in the photo-mode.

Combat system is an improvement over Valhalla's never ending ""strike-strike-roll"" loop. If you don't pay attention to what's going on around you and zone the enemies accordingly, you are going to be dying a lot, which I love. It gives an actual real incentive to at least try getting as many enemies down, shinobi-style, before the sword fighting starts.

Parkour animations on Naoe are the best they've been in a long time. 

Bugs are there, but not in a regular Ubisoft fashion where everything is just straight up goofy.

Anyways, if you don't just hate on the game because reddit or twitter told you so, and you are into exploring good looking open world games - you are going to enjoy it.

190799281,english,"If you are a critical thinker, you will see this game for what it is: 
A PEERLESS WORK OF ART that sets the standard to how Medieval Hippon/Hihon should be depicted in media. 
People complained about in Valhalla due to Eivor, a Viking warrior, not being fit to be an assassin...
Well this game lets you live the ultimate assassin fantasy as Naoe or the ruthless ultimate killing machine Yasuke. 
Given the abrasion of the Japanese Government towards UbiSoft & the game (due to some shrine destruction footage), the company will not have an easy time, but all of this can actually help the game more than scathe it, due to honing it into the best media tribute ever bestowed upon Nippon and I dare say the whole 'WORUDO'.

I do like how being a ninja feels. I do like being a Samurai. However, the combat feels like it is Ghost of Tsushima from Wish. Mirage was a step in the right direction of maintaining the vibes of Assassin's Creed, but Shadows feels like its 8 steps back from modern games.

190798132,english,"It's not perfect, but don't let the internet make you think that means it's bad. It's a pretty big improvement on previous titles. 

Voice acting should probably be set to ""Immersive"" though, the English voice acting is janky at times. And we all know that Ubisoft can take their Connect crap and shove it.

Otherwise it's a solid experience. Holds your hand less than previous titles by default so it's actually fun to explore the world instead of feeling like a big checklist. 
Naoe feels great to play as, she fits the assassin role perfectly. Her story is pretty generic, but I think the game pulls it off well, so who cares. I'll withhold any concrete opinions on Yasuke until I play some more, he is barely present for the first few hours. When he is he feels totally different, which is good but will probably steer most people to just use Naoe for almost everything.",True,0,0,1742561566,76561198112173930,604

Yes AC games were not the best in the last years. And yes Ubisoft is definitly not a gamers favourite publisher.

But when it comes to AC:Shadows. It makes fun! It is a high polished AC Game with a very interesting open world in Japan.
The Steath mechanics are back and remind me on the first two AC titles. 
If you liked Odyssey and Valhalla more, then you can play with Yasuke instead of the Stealth focused Naoe.

Clevery twist from Ubi to try to satisfy both player types.

I have a lot of fun",True,0,0,1742561517,76561198016335996,1274
190797634,english,"I’ve been a fan of Assassin’s Creed since the beginning. I’ve also been deeply disappointed by it—especially in recent years. Valhalla was a low point: boring combat, a painful slog of a story (I couldn’t even get through the game without skipping half the cutscenes), and if you could ""fat-finger"" parkour, they fat-fingered the LIVING ISH out of parkour. Odyssey was a solid RPG and dare I say an AMAZING game, but let’s be honest—calling it Assassin’s Creed was a branding decision, not a design one.

So when Assassin’s Creed Shadows dropped, I came in with a cautious and abusive relationship between pessimism and optimism- and after 15 years of wanting AC in Japan… I really wanted this game to be the GOAT.. But in all honesty, I didn’t expect this game to be the one. Oh how fantastically wrong I was.

This is the best Assassin’s Creed game Ubisoft has ever made.

First, the combat. While the katana combat itself doesn't quite reach the depth, weight and impact of Ghost of Tsushima, the weapon variety easily fills in the gap. Whether you're using a katana, tanto w/ hidden blade, or even the badass kusarigama, every option feels intentional and satisfying. It's fast, fluid, and finally—finally—feels like it belongs in an Assassin’s Creed game.

Then there's the parkour. Up until now, Unity was the gold standard- And lord know the special folk who think pre-ACIII parkour was peak are gonna hate this.. I mean, If I had a nickel for every time I heard someone complain about the lack of “hEigHt gAiNiNG bAcK EjeCts” I’d have enough money to buy another copy of Assassin’s Creed Shadows Deluxe Edition 😐 BUT ANYWAYS, back to what I was saying: Shadows has officially surpassed Unity, becoming the #1 parkour system in the franchise. Movement feels fast, stylish, and meaningful again. You’re not Spider-man anymore, freely climbing flat walls; you're DELIBERATELY flowing through the environment like you’re meant to be there. Urban traversal feels like a mechanic again, this time with all the exaggerated swagger of a Feudal Japan Shinobi.

The story? Surprisingly excellent. While it doesn't delve as deep into the AC lore as much as I wanted it to.. for the first time since Ezio, I was balls deep-invested in the animus story (though unfortunately, there's not much of a modern story this time). The plot has structure, weight, and momentum. And while Naoe and Yasuke might not have Ezio’s charisma, they really don't need it—because the world around them is grounded, emotional, and beautifully acted (and I cannot stress this enough, in IMMERSIVE MODE… because the English voice acting is straight up BAD). Perhaps the most surprising of all… the CINEMATOGRAPHY. It's honestly a STANDOUT at times—stark, stylized, and full of intentional framing that evokes a kind of Tarantino-meets-Kurosawa vibe. It's like the game periodically gets possessed by the soul of KILL BILL.

This is the first time in years the series has truly felt like a stealth assassin game again, without sacrificing modern design. And it doesn’t feel like a copy of something else either—it respects its influences but has its own identity.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows isn’t just a return to form. It’s the form finally realized.",True,0,0,1742561091,76561198324553090,7176
